I was knocking myself out to finish on time, made great effort, also, have a good time.
Don't knock yourself out, it is not worth that much effort.
Have you given any thought to this idea.
Let me get this straight: are you saying that you won't help us? Understand what is true and what is stated to be true.
Go to any length to attain it, do whatever is necessary, to great length.
Misguided expectations.
A load of bullshit, loads of problems.

Follow the chain of reasoning, and the value judgement.

Knock him out of the horse in a joust.
This term doesn't come close.
Promoted by virtue of her experience, because of it.

Bounded randomness creates aggregate certainty, limited randomness.
Otherwise, you end up with a circular argument.
The model explained a great deal of what is experimentally observed.
The simplest argument I can come up with.
It depends on what account we choose to believe.
Following up on our conversation, I'm sending you the proposal for your review.
Pursuant to our conversation, I have enclosed for your review a rough sketch of the writ.
Third and most important.

In fact it just hastens the demise of this kind of belief.
Pretty useful within their limitations.
It led us in many false directions, hence we should learn caution.
It goes far beyond that we are capable of perceiving.
Then a weird thought overtook me.
Crisis overtook the country, befell.
All those late nights are really starting to catch up with me, begin to affect.
The technique is a centerpiece of the theory.

This Question, though quite flawed, is actually of great interest.
When you make sense of it, you succeed in understanding it. Can you make sense of these instructions.
Get ahold of yourself.
The annex purports to bear evidence.
Why bring it up, raise the issue.
First let's nail down a plan.
For a handful of reasons.

After a great deal of thought, of effort, learn a great deal from it.
This alone will not do.
We can come to terms with them.

Suspected of dissent.
Dismiss it as entirely worthless and irrelevant.

They put a great deal of time, effort and dedication into the process.
To what do I owe this pleasure, honour.
We are not plain stupid.
Spare them from that pain.
It can stir feelings of pity. 

A commoner, an ordinary person, without rank or title.
They scoured the libraries in search of those papers, subject to thorough search.
Tightly interweaving the strands, interwoven, intertwined.
Make a scene, make a public disturbance or excited emotional display.
No need to christen them like this, dub, label, call, baptise.
Broaden your horizon.
I have to hustle, rush, jostle.

Decision grounded in faulty assumptions, predicated on misrepresentation.
They harp on about this idea, nag persistently and annoyingly about the issue, boring and endlessly.
Bruit something about, to spread a rumor around in a loose and gossipy manner.
They are bruiting about that story as if it's the truth.
Snap election, called earlier than the one scheduled.
These raise the difficulty level.
He didn't give a fig for it and severed all ties.
So if Eris is not a planet, then clearly Pluto can’t be either.
It lays bare the problem of just how exclusive this model really was.
He could use to enact petty vendettas.
Inveterate liars who needed to have the truth tortured out of them.

Not finished within the allotted time.
I had no prior knowledge of that.
A crude calculation yields a divergent result.
Then we part ways, end relationship, parted ways with the company.
Conveniently picked.
Next time you come across it, spare a thought for the alternative option, think about it.
Unglamorous functionaries only noticed when they screwed up.
This view does not cohere with their other beliefs, stick firmly together in a mass that resists separation.
Premature demise.
Everything you touch turns to garbage.

What doesn't sit right.

For now, we’ll leave it outside our discussion.
Comprehensive agreement, complete, including all or nearly all elements or aspects of something.
He is a slacker, who avoids work and effort.
Sink into oblivion, lost to obscurity, not remembered by anyone.
Go in blind, without any knowledge of the outcome.
Which is, ipso facto, a good thing, per se, by itself.
As to those who now escaped his memory, he would proscribe them at some future time.
Sulla: No friend ever served me, and no enemy ever wronged me, whom I have not repaid in full.
Couldn't have put it better myself.
Atrocious micarriage of justice.
We'd be better off without you.

We want the issue addressed quickly.
I want this done properly.
Blatant lie, glaring, grossly impudent.
Have it arranged.
Declare a hunger strike.
Raise suspicions.
Only need to agree terms with them.
I barely know more than you do.
Experience teaches.
Get to the point, enough rambling.
Defer to the experts, to the court.
Ways to remedy it.

He'll check on the matter and report back, check on your progress.
I'm just checking in to see if it is done.
The court is to take cognisance of it.
A sheer wanton vandalism.
Because things are slightly more nuanced than that.
It had undergone a drastic change.
Cronies and their ilk, similar to those referred to.
With a reasonable advance notice.
Their score-settling.
This is the extent of my knowledge on the subject.
Allegations leveled against him proved pure fiction.
Wolfgang Pauli: “it is not only not right; it is not even wrong.”
It seems at first sight paradoxical to the reader that.

Brought a spate of claims, flurry, influx, flood, deluge, stream.
I have a little/last favour to ask.
They sought to make an educated man out of him.
He did not take that message to heart, take it seriously.
For what it's worth, whether or not it's significant or useful.
No one piece of evidence states it in straightforward and unambiguous language either.
He’s lazy, and he’ll never amount to anything.
What we had direct evidence of.
Data based on very uncertain estimates.
He was reasoning that.
Silly sounding, tentative opinion, provisional.
The natural question arises.
Invectives creeping into your language.
Trust his childhood friends in all things.
I know a fair bit about it.

To privilege this very hypothesis.
I like all of the above.
Demands to give up on logics.
Speculations take precedence over facts.
Matter of opinion vs matter of fact.
Ignorant is not a disparaging word.
It is mentioned in passing.
After the prediction came true, proved true.
Without taking anything away therefrom.
Things which we hold most dear.
Lay readers.

With reasonable likelihood, it should set your alarm ringing.
We are only halfway done.
Can't bear to face the others.
Thoughtful people of any stripe.
Many countries de-pegged their currencies from the U.S. dollar.
To no avail, without any success or any effect, efforts were of no avail.
An overkill, excessive amount or degree.
Put a lid on a pot and contain the situation.
Seems to fault the administration for not adequately react.
One thing to call out is that.

He reportedly quizzed random passers-by about his merits.
Keep track of bloodline.
Guilty of actions surrounding the events of that time.
Let him stew for a while.
Bloated with self-importance.
I'm stuffed.
People runs riot, behave in uncontrolled way, imagination is running riot.
We debriefed our colleagues, listened to the report on their mission.

It is far more likely to mislead than help.
Be away of the touch of civilisation.
The list of questions goes on.
Overcoming boredom.

De-escalation, travesty of justice, the resolve hardened.
With the wisdom of hindsight, I should have done it – understand only after the event is consumed, with the benefit of hindsight.
And see where it lands you.
Misplaced truth, ill-chosen, ill-timed.
Jog your memory, cause to remember.
I was long-winded, repetitive and rambling.
Just a quibble: one doesn’t usually talk about objects that have no mass.
Quackery, charlatanry, fraud, swindle.

To cheer ourselves up, we are cheerful people.
The solution dawned on us, it began to be realised for the first time.
Determined to root it out, find and remove, steely determination.
How are you getting on, fare, cope, manage.
We'll set to work on this tomorrow.
His statements are controversial, but in all fairness to him, they are also grounded. In fairness.
Fix the problem by staring at it, come up with a solution once we come across the problem.
Implementation at its finest.
You can't contain yourselves, and must rid yourselves of it.

We'll look into it.
A con man, cunning person, a person who uses tricks to cheat people, esp. to get their money or possessions.
Provide ready access, free access.
A viper in bosom, he is rearing a viper for the people.
Be exempt from taxes or duty.

With hindsight, I should never have gone, retrospectively.
Then he quipped.

The only evidence against it is and has always been a rigidly literal interpretation of a single poem which was composed in the Bronze Age and passed along by word of mouth for centuries before it was written down, and which was probably always intended as a metaphor.
More importantly, though, he dismisses any potential role for human choice.
Tilted inwards, double-deck train.

Almost beyond comprehension.
Forgo a long introduction.
Slim chances.
But let's assume for a while that the map is truly reflective of the realities of that remote past.
Unless you have a better idea.
It calls for a closer scrutiny.
Leave us leeway, room to maneuver.
What went through your mind.
Find the circumstances present.
Have it brought or lost.
This means that people fall back on metaphors, analogies or hand-wavy over-simplifications which – unsurprisingly – can confuse more than illuminate.
The decision rests with you.
Be on the fritz, malfunction.

The questions I want answering.
A more appealing option.

For once in my life.
They are integral to the system.
I bet it is. I bet you are.
Whatever the future holds.
Strange as it might sound, strangely enough.
Here lies the problem.

Address and redress the complaints if appropriate.
The recognition of extenuating circumstances.
To pinpoint the relevant legal issues, find or locate exactly.
When all appeals before the national courts have been exhausted.
Other issues may arise.
By producing an extract from the commercial register.
Dependent on the instructions sent to the Registry.
Set a deadline for that action.
Impugned decisions or judgments, in dispute.
No time limit is foreseen here.
There is extensive information and guidance on this.
The Registry will write to the lawyer concerned pointing out the deficiencies.
Provide adequate redress and, as appropriate, to take necessary remedial measures.
Where exceptional circumstances so justify.
