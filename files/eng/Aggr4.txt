It is capped at five, restricted to, set a limit on.

They don’t share the language, nor customs.
They brought their share of confusion into this.

My bet: it was significantly exaggerated for political purpose.

They tried to gloss over the problem, cover up, play down, minimise, obscure or concreal.
Salacious details, indecent, onscene, pronographic, vulgar, lewd.
It really is the other way around.
Examples abound.
Most of the time people mean well.
I try not to curse.
It has nothing whatsoever to do with that.

What planet do you come from?
Before you spout preposterous counter-factual questions of this type - you have just read this crap that was recently published.

Consolidated his tight grip over the institutions.
Tighten the grip on something.
Expound the facts, set forth or lay down, expose our views.
Most readily observed. Not in our lifetime.
Lost for words, shocked that don’t know what to say.
We get bonded, befriended.
I don’t see it happening.
Acculturation, transfer of values and customs from one group to another - people get acculturated.

To tarnish my reputation, discolor, blacken, taint it.
The other way around, the opposite way.

Have a word with you, chat briefly.
How they behave in the wild.

They tout vegetables, attempt to sell in a pestering manner, recommend, peddle.
They flaunt their wealth, brag, show off, display ostentatiously, parade, to impress or attract notice.
All along, all the time.
