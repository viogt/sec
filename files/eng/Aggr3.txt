You can whinge the rest of your life about it.
Wiggle out of attending the party, of complying with the law.
So why do we blabber about it?
The whole question is nonsensical and moot.
Exacerbate the situation, make it worse.
Get it done the right and humane way.
Sorry for the delay in responding.
Up until this point, it lends itself to simplicity of explanation.


Blatant sophistry fallacious arguments with the intention of deceiving.

In-person debate.
In order for the equation to work the way it’s supposed to.
This is the uncertainty principle at work.
Note, though, that…
I'm fed up of this nonsense.
Insatiable demand, greedy, to endorse the deal.


I strongly disagree with your premise.
Used to poke holes in the theory.
The whistleblower leaked out the information.
I've lost count of how many times I've heard of it.
Rehash old propaganda, reuse old ideas without significant change or improvement.
Jot it down on paper, write quickly, in small account.

They were tearing down the Berlin Wall.
It breathes new life into the saying.
I’ll close with two remarks.
Vast literature grew up around this notion.
Famous aperçu, insight, outline, comment or brief reference that makes an illuminating or entertaining point, like “biggest blunder”.
More effect than the model accounts for.
It demonstrably exists, soon it became evident.
Probing deeper into science.
Before you read any further.
Follow the spacetime geodesic.


Pay little attention, he said rolling his eyes.
It’s beyond ludicrous to mention.
Crisis as yet unperceived by those possessing power.
Freaking out the neighbours, go crazy and out of mind.
Pareidolia, interpret as shapes in the clouds, subcategory of apophenia, mistakenly perceive connections and meaning between unrelated things.
Honing your skills, perfecting, refining, sharpen.
Hang on a minute, we did not sign up to this.
It did little to enamour the public to this idea, of it.
Rise and smile.
A crude way of putting it into words is that.
The response is reversing the slur, insinuation to insult or damage the reputation.
They can’t make headway in solving problems.


Now, onto the question.
If you don’t mind the question.
Entangle the discussion with fraught questions.
The second stroke, nail in the coffin.
But joking aside, this is a serious problem.
Act precipitously, hastily and without careful consideration.
More questions than there seem to be answers for.
After the laughter had died down.
Cascading effect, start the ball rolling.
Best working hypothesis to date.
Figurehead, a nominal leader or head without real power.

Conduct yourselves, contain your emotions.
False sense of urgency.
First a digression.
Go rogue, on its own interest, against instructions or orders.
Feel great affinity with it, sympathy.
Tidy up the room.
At the allotted time.
Morass, an area of muddy or boggy ground.
The family name was elided, pass by in silence, omit, overlook, abridge, leave out of consideration.
Demur (object), raise doubts or objections or show reluctance, dissent or dispute, have qualms or reservations.
I was silenced and could not demur.
Sketchy evidence, lacking completeness, inadequate, rough.
I am afraid I have disappointing news.


Money mishandled, cases are getting mishandled.
Couldn’t keep up with the tendencies.
Over to you, now is your turn.
To offer a meaningful response to this question, it is important to recap a few key dates.
In point of fact, it is a marvelous demonstration.
I’ve done my best. Now it’s over to the professionals.
Loophole, gap, ambiguity in the law, workaround, subterfuge.
Mountains of data.
Store it in the back of your head, for another day.
Don’t have time to go over all of these.
In summation, follow the letter rather than the spirit of it.
I was under the impression.


I'll reprise this, repeat.
On the point of giving it up.
He has begun to fidget on his chair, small movements of the hands and feet through nervousness or impatience.
He had a stint as a manager. Host stinted on the wine.
Remission of debts, of sins, cancellation.
Cache of gold, stored in a hidden or inaccessible place.
Assumptions which are not universally endorsed.
Scribble, writing produced carelessly or hurriedly.
You might spot opportunities to improve, correct typos.
Keep it simple, less is more.
Shapeshifter, person with the ability to change his physical form at will.
It doesn’t pose any issue to the matter.


What the heck is this? Pretty damn punctual.
The plan was not to work out.
As we move down the list we see that, move down the agenda.
To do something a little off the beaten path.
Something bordering on the mysterious.
Pinnacle of the regime, climax, zenith, peak, culmination.
This invitation bespeaks a recognition of, is evidence of, is indicative of.
Question that puzzled scientists over a century ago.
Much to everyone’s dismay, it is no different than another.

The film is stuck in memory, it sticks in my memory.
It budded off the cell, the weeds begin to sprout.
In order to preempt any accusation.
First it gives the idea, the impression that…
Weak character who served as a pawn of the king.
The claim is not without merit.
Triggering the crisis.
Until the storm subsides, wane, relent, ebb, abate.
To quench the thirst for glory, quell the anger, clung to it.
Explanation, excerpted from an article, gleaned.
The reasons are, I suspect, twofold.
The interest came about when calculating.


In haphazard manner, lacking any principle of organisation, unsystematic.
The book is definitely worth a read, worth a try.
So two possibilities arise.
Have conceded to this fact, if you're pedantic.
Ancillary claim, supplemental and dependant on another claim.
Interlocutory judgment, given provisionally during the course of a legal action.
A tardy decision, delayed, belated, overdue, behind schedule, sluggish.


For better or for worse, under any conditions; no matter what happens.
Via the aided or unaided senses.
To spin up the web server.
Oh, and for the record.
False premise implies nonsense, false prerequisite.
Insuperable by our imagination, impossible to overcome.
Considered as subversive of the theory, to subvert, pernicious.
Let me inject a note of caution.
Thus far, this is merely a restatement of the fallacious argument.
The arch is one of, if not the, most difficult of design problems.

Pull the plug on the project, discontinue.
Warriors casting loud taunts at each other.
He is taunting us, mocking us, scoffing at us.
A spiffed-up version, more attractive.
Attempts to amass observations to support the conclusion, discarding any that do not.
By virtue of his tangential association with them.
To get ahold of an official order, manage to contact, obtain.
Track down the stolen billions.
Gibbering chorus of voices, mumbing, speak unintelligibly.
Used as a launching pad.
Try your luck, return in force.


As though you were a child, widespread myths.
To juggle with sophisms and conjure proofs.
Is always just about to change.
We made for him, run toward something or someone.
Stupor mundi, wonder of the world.
Libel, a published false statement, written defamation.
Give vent to this feeling, now as before.
For sheer love of the game.
Before you step in the case, I’ll set up the meeting.
As of this moment.


In remembrance of it.
The machine spins out of control.
Turn things around and put the horse before the cart.
To take it with a grain of salt, or a pinch of salt, with a degree of scepticism.
Required to forgo discussing it, do without.
Is it possible to ever know for sure.
They couldn’t get past the border, an obstacle.
A notion we know today is hogwash, nonsense, baloney.
The bulwark of nationalism, defence wall, bastion.
Ergo, hence, therefore, consequently, accordingly.


Go astray, away from the correct path or direction.
Save your question for the end of the story.
Has a personal political slant, viewpoint, stance, angle.
A news slant on science.
The news slanted, biased, twisted, distorted.
Don’t overdo, go overboard with it.
Have a scent, a trail of smell and perceptible to hounds.
We shall take all means to prevent such a situation.
It changed beyond recognition.
To wear out the shoes, become worn.
Moron, obtuse or blinker, it blinkers them.
Sneaking suspicion, nagging, in stealthy manner.


To the delight of the beholders.
Are we done lying.
I screwed it up, mishandled.
I had to control my temper.
Don't mind the mess, don't pay attention to it, pay no attention to it.
When he was asked, flat out.
Power is the ultimate aphrodisiac.
Scroll past this section if you’re already familiar with it.
But that likely matters little to its target demographic.
Notice any sort of sluggishness.
It leaves some to be desired.
Lost in the crowd.


Draining the swamp.
Their paymaster.
Without resolute actions.
I think we can do better.
Beggars can't be choosers.
The fire laid waste the house, destroy, ruin.
Stampede of wild rhinoceroses, sudden panicked rush, escape, skedaddle.
What it would exactly look like.
It sucks up resources that could be allocated elsewhere.
A look of haughty disdain, presumptuous, arrogant, snobbish.


I’ll see to it, take care of it, see to changing it.
Attackers were lying in wait for me, await from a concealed position, lurk.
He was disposed to aid us, resolutely.
It gave me food for thought.
Avoid a head-on clash, frontal, unequivocally.
Put it off till tomorrow.
Sloppy people, negligent, careless, lax.
It may conceivably cause disease, theoretically, presumably.
Ask any conceivable question.
The totality of all there is.
For everybody’s sake, for my sake.
Told these poor deluded souls.
Myths surrounding it.


Come to a dead end, reach a dead end, run into a dead end.
None of the candidates are up to the challenge.
Tools at hand.
Let’s give it a try.
The answer is rooted in economics.
Don’t be hard on yourself, he was hard on me.
It's blindingly obvious to everyone, glaringly.
He was musing on the problems, absorbed in thought.
Submitted a revised version titled “On this”.
We locked horns with each other.
Attempts to poke holes in their claims, highlight a flow in it.
It drove me to decide, compel.


I don't like to be beholden to anybody, ow thanks, in return for help or service, indebted.
Malaise, a general feeling of discomfort, illness, or uneasiness whose exact cause is difficult to identify.
Do yourself a favour and don’t buy into it.
You can’t do that unless you are broadly knowledgeable in the subject.
He could see ways that others could not fathom.
Says who? They claim rescission of the Agreement.
At first blush, glance, sight.
It doesn’t pull any punches, speak very bluntly and directly, without regard to whether it may upset someone.


Where did you get it from?
You’re entitled to your secrets.
We would urge caution.
I wholeheartedly recommend it.
From the bottom of my heart.
Like the diagram shows.
Sanitised to conform to our official version.
Drum roll.
A lot of subtleties.
Vague inkling of what it should look like, hint, suspicion, hunch, indication, clue.
Talk about inconsequential things, insignificant,  inappropriate, the consequential skirmish, resulting, important.


On that day or thereabouts.
Worse yet, he has achieved little.
The answer is longer and less satisfying than you’d have liked.
Not under any obligation to be easily comprehensible.
I didn't chicken out, I just changed my mind.
That is more likely to mislead than to enlighten.
However, this is no simple topic, fuller answer is more nuanced.
In the queue to board the plane, lady at the counter was adamant.
The Universe revolves around you.
The luckiest man alive, on the planet.


Problems pile up, accumulated in a heap.
No matter the cost, it came to this.
Negotiations have floundered, struggle helplessly in water or mud, mired, bogged down.
Every possible vagary of human behavior, whim, caprice, freak.
It’s just some passing fad, craze, widespread but short-lived enthusiasm.
Infringement committed with the connivance of officials.
The emperor has no clothes.
Notoriety, being famous for some bad quality or deed.
One of our proudest achievements.
Whichever way you choose, refine your definition.
Nobody lifted a finger.


The thrill will fade.
Be true to my word, keep the promise.
Stop whinging, complain persistently in an irritating way.
Lay a trap for someone, or set a trap.
Inveigle, persuade (someone) to do something by means of deception or flattery.
Surmise my intentions, guess, guesstimate the vote, on scanty evidence.
That's what I flatter myself with.
To use imprecise but figurative language.
A short stroll before the meeting, strolling troubadours.
On what grounds, to some extent.
Stand out from the crowd, here comes the weird part.


A distraught person, deeply upset and agitated.
Chairman, CEO and owner rolled in one.
A spoof president, parody, humorous imitation of something, mockery, exaggerated stereotype, satire, ruse.
To spoof someone with false information, play a trick.
To lay bare the details of their relationship, reveal.
The report laid bare the facts.
Put on hold a decision about it.
A CIA spook. To spook the customers.
Allegiance, devotion or loyalty to a person, the obligation of a feudal vassal to his lord.
To top it all off.
Dividing is a key pillar of the security strategy.
Elected on a pledge to fight corruption.


Run errands, or run an errand.
Hold onto flawed practice.
No better than an average pissant.
Anything remotely related to this, sniffing the subject.
Less open to interpretations.
He seems quite knowledgeable about that.
Not your fault.
Making little headway, progress, move forward.
Prove worthy of admiration.
Indulge my curiosity.
In support of what you've said.
Give or take, less or more, give or take a little.


Too young to reason with and too old to spank, slap buttocks.
Einstein: if you can't explain it to your grandmother, you don't understand it yourself.
Give it a try, a go, a whirl, a shot.
Have a backbone, have no spine, spineless person, lacking strength of character.
In retort, in revenge, wittily incisive reply to a remark, rejoin.
I seem to receive - no doubt well-intentioned - edit suggestions, typo.
To remedy the problem, cure, rectify.
With varying degrees of accuracy.


Here are my 2 cents.
Short sightedness, myopia, farsightedness.
Looking further afield, in the same domain.
Tends to be overhyped.
To woo someone with pledges, gain the love of a woman, with a view to marriage.
Devolve into the predicament, degenerate into, roll down, deteriorate, discussion devolved into a skirmish.
Until he is called upon to testify.
Get a respire, an intermission.
We flunked the exam, failed the case, opportunity manqué, flunk the test.
Last I saw you, you wrote us, we’ll talk more later.


Is this plain enough for you, bluntly put across.
If it please you, wear it as a badge of honour.
Sudden turn of events, shocked at the unexpected turn of events.
We are mindful of the lawsuit unfolding, aware of, conscious.
See what the words are worth. Don’t get up.
Wonderful rendition of the role, interpretation.
Rats living in sewers, not trustworthy.
Keep on paddling, get on boat and row with oars.
From what I can tell, dare I say it.


The ambient temperature determines communication.
Fair enough, couldn’t agree more.
It seems gross incompetence.
I meant no disrespect.
Day of reckoning.
Beyond dispute. I dare not refuse.
