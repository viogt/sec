It's his job (business).</p><p>- I will not say that women have no character; rather, they have a new one every day.</p><p>- The men of action are, after all, only the unconscious instruments of the men of thought.</p><p>Winnie the Pooh:</p><p>- “People say nothing is impossible, but I do nothing every day.”</p><p>- “Think, think, think.”</p><p>- “Think it over, think it under.”</p><p>- “It's not much of a tail, but I'm sort of attached to it.”</p><p>- “We'll be Friends Forever, won't we, Pooh?' asked Piglet. Even longer,' Pooh answered.”</p><p>- “He was telling an interesting anecdote full of exciting words like "encyclopedia" and "rhododendron".”</p><p>- “Honey or condensed milk with your bread?” he was so excited that he said, “Both,” and then, so as not to seem greedy, he added, “but don’t bother about the bread, please.”</p><p>- “The things that make me different are the things that make me ME. -Piglet”</p><p>- “I knew when I met you an adventure was going to happen.”</p><p>Napoleon Bonaparte at Josephine Bonaparte’s rose garden, at the Chateau de Malmaison, in 1802</p><p>- Napoleon: “Newton spoke of God in his book. I have perused yours but failed to find his name even once. Why?”
- Laplace: “I have no need of that hypothesis”</p><p>Je n’avais pas besoin de cette hypothèse-là. Ah! c’est une belle hypothèse; ça explique beaucoup de choses.</p><p>Napoleon Bonaparte (1817), “Dialogue with Gaspard Gourgaud”</p><p>- “I have dictated thirty pages on the world's three religions; and I have read the Bible. My own opinion is made up. I do not think Jesus Christ ever existed. I would believe in the Christian religion if it dated from the beginning of the world. That Socrates, Plato, the Mohammedan, and all the English should be damned is too absurd. Jesus was probably put to death, like many other fanatics who proclaimed themselves to be prophets or the expected Messiah. Every year there were many of these men.”</p><p>- “I read the Bible. Moses was an able man. The Jews were a cowardly and cruel people.”</p><p>- “When I see that a dog or a pig has a stomach and can eat, I say to myself, ‘I have a soul, they must have one too’. Give my watch to a savage and he will think it has a soul.”</p><p>- “A man may have no religion, but may yet have morality. He must have morality for the sake of society. Morality for the better classes, the scaffold for la canaille.”</p><p>- “I often asked Laplace what he thought of God. He owned he was an atheist. Many crimes have been committed in the name of religion."</p><p>Around 1880, some French professors attempted to formulate a secular morality, they expressed it more or less in these words: God is a useless and a costly hypothesis, so we will do without it.
Jean-Paul Sartre</p><p>Richard Dawkins</p><p>- We are all atheists about most of the gods that societies have ever believed in. Some of us just go one god further.</p><p>- The universe we observe has precisely the properties we should expect if there is, at bottom, no design, no purpose, no evil, no good, nothing but blind, pitiless indifference.</p><p>- When the ancestors of the cheetah first began pursuing the ancestors of the gazelle, neither of them could run as fast as they can today.</p><p>- We admit that we are like apes, but we seldom realise that we are apes.</p><p>- If something is true, no amount of wishful thinking will change it.</p><p>- To fill a world with religion, or religions of the Abrahamic kind, is like littering the streets with loaded guns. Do not be surprised if they are used.</p><p>- I guess the Democrats have to pretend to be more pious than the Republicans because they are under suspicion of not being.</p><p>- I am baffled by the way sophisticated theologians who know Adam and Eve never existed still keep talking about it.</p><p>- In Britain, Christianity is dying. Islam, unfortunately, isn't.</p><p>- All the fossils that we have ever found have always been found in the appropriate place in the time sequence. There are no fossils in the wrong place.</p><p>- People really, really hate their religion being criticized. It's as though you've said they had an ugly face; they seem to identify personally with it.</p><p>- To an honest judge, the alleged marriage between religion and science is a shallow, empty, spin-doctored sham.</p><p>- The state of Israel seems to owe its very existence to the American Jewish vote, while at the same time consigning the non-religious to political oblivion.</p><p>- To put it bluntly, American political opportunities are heavily loaded against those who are simultaneously intelligent and honest.</p><p>- God stands out in the universe as the most glaring of all superfluous sore thumbs.</p><p>- Do you advocate the Ten Commandments as a guide to the good life? Then I can only presume that you don't know the Ten Commandments.</p><p>- The central dogma of the New Testament is that Jesus died as a scapegoat for the sin of Adam and the sins that all we unborn generations might have been contemplating in the future. Adam's sin is perhaps mitigated by the extenuating circumstance that he didn't exist.</p><p>- Presumably what happened to Jesus was what happens to all of us when we die. We decompose. Accounts of Jesus's resurrection and ascension are about as well-documented as Jack and the Beanstalk.</p><p>- Natural selection will not remove ignorance from future generations.</p><p>- You can legally lie about the real world to your heart's content, but until some human being is materially damaged, nobody will complain.</p><p>Mathematics is the art of giving the same name to different things.
Henri Poincare</p><p>

Any intelligent fool can make things bigger, more complex, and more violent.
It takes a touch of genius — and a lot of courage — to move in the opposite direction.
Albert Einstein</p><p>Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.
Leonardo da Vinci</p><p>Ignorance more frequently begets confidence than does knowledge: it is those who know little, not those who know much, who so positively assert that this or that problem will never be solved by science.
Charles Darwin,
Introduction to The Descent of Man, 1871</p><p>Religion is regarded by the common people as true, by the wise as false, and by the rulers as useful.
Seneca the Younger</p><p>I do not feel obliged to believe that the same God who has endowed us with sense, reason, and intellect has intended us to forgo their use.
Galileo Galilei</p><p>There is nothing divine about morality; it is a purely human affair.
Albert Einstein, 1954</p><p>To surrender to ignorance and call it God has always been premature, and it remains premature today.
Isaac Asimov</p><p>Religion is an illusion and it derives its strength from its readiness to fit in with our instinctual wishful impulses.
Sigmund Freud</p><p>The idea of a personal God is an anthropological concept which I am unable to take seriously.
Albert Einstein,
letter to Hoffman and Dukas, 1946</p><p>We can allow satellites, planets, suns, universe, nay whole systems of universes to be governed by laws, but the smallest insect, we wish to be created at once by special act.
Charles Darwin</p><p>When it was first said that the sun stood still and world turned round, the common sense of mankind declared the doctrine false; but the old saying of Vox populi, vox Dei [the voice of the people is the voice of God], as every philosopher knows, cannot be trusted in science.
Charles Darwin</p><p>What if God were not exactly truth, and if this could be proved? And if he were instead the vanity, the desire for power, the ambitions, the fear, and the enraptured and terrified folly of mankind?
Nietzsche, 1890</p><p>Do not allow yourselves to be deceived: Great Minds are Skeptical.
Nietzsche, 1890</p><p>One strength of the Communist system ... is that it has some of the characteristics of a religion and inspires the emotions of a religion.
Albert Einstein,
Out Of My Later Years, 1950</p><p>The foundation of morality should not be made dependent on myth nor tied to any authority lest doubt about the myth or about the legitimacy of the authority imperil the foundation of sound judgment and action.
Albert Einstein</p><p>I deal with the obvious. I present, reiterate and glorify the obvious —  because the obvious is what people need to be told.
Dale Carnegie</p><p>There is nothing as deceptive as an obvious fact.
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle</p><p>No question is so difficult to answer as that to which the answer is obvious.
George Bernard Shaw</p><p>We are to admit no more causes of natural things than such as are both true and sufficient to explain their appearances.
Sir Isaac Newton,
Principia: The system of the world</p><p>I have called this principle, by which each slight variation, if useful, is preserved, by the term Natural Selection.
    Charles Darwin</p>

<p><b>Dale Carnegie:</u><br>
“Personally I am very fond of strawberries and cream, but I have found that for some strange reason, fish prefer worms. So when I went fishing, I didn’t think about what I wanted. I thought about what they wanted. I didn't bait the hook with strawberries and cream. Rather, I dangled a worm or grasshopper in front of the fish and said: "Wouldn't you like to have that?" Why not use the same common sense when fishing for people?”</p>
<p><b>Euclid:</u><br>
Ptolemy 1st Soter, first king of Egypt after the death of Alexander the Great, personally sponsored Euclid, but found Euclid's seminal work, the Elements, too difficult to study, so he asked Euclid to show him an easier way to master it. According to the philosopher Proclus, Euclid famously quipped: "Sire, there is no royal road to geometry."</p>
