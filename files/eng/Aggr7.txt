It lags far behind the best foreign analogs, and we have to scale down our ambitions.
Yet public awareness is low.
What did I get out of it?
It reveals the dormant bugs of the system.
It revolves around several aspects.
I'm glad they don't have that stuff shoved down their throats these days.
I feel the urge to comment on this, have a strong wish to do so.
Let's send for a doctor and pass him the information to back up the story.
To redefine the problem to suit our own solutions.
They are not exceptions, but aren't quite the norm either.
Before we laugh it off, present the unpleasant as unimportant.
After the conference you also get a freebie, a gift from the company.
I need to call in a favour from an old colleague.
They were warned about interference ahead of the elections.
Just so we can say we tried.
They probably believed it was accurate, however, wishing don’t make it so.
The adviser could weigh in on a plan, add advices or comments.
It is called that as part of the global conspiracy to keep it confusing.
I've seen it many a time in the past, many times, frequently.
They have next to connection whatsoever.
Bask in the glory ensuing.
Your behaviour is out of line, beyond what is reasonable or allowable, not right or appropriate.

The ability to sift through the big data and filter the valuable ones.
Probably not that much of a surprise.
Who would've thought.
The case has intensified a long-simmering debate about free speech.
Unless my memory fails me, unless my eyes fail me.
To blame him for the world’s ills.
That’s rich (absurd or ridiculous). And yet sitting on the fence. Nope, not buying it. I need more evidence before I make up my mind.
At current rates of spending, we are in the fast lane to bankruptcy.
He is cosplaying as a judge, the hobby of dressing as and pretending to be a character from a film or comic book.
I find it hard to believe but they brush off this version, dismiss it in an abrupt manner.
You are now ready to pick fights with everyone.
To save the fanatics the embarrassment of presenting false arguments.
It will always increase over time, but have another go.
Looks like I am a little late to the party.
He claimed it with a straight face.
But the report was short on details about finding a source for the investment required to reverse the economic decline.
They seemed determined to goad us into a fight, to make us react by continuously annoying us.
How he could remain within sight of being promoted, and not being within our grasp.
He faced the disaster with unflagging (unrelenting) courage and never sought refuge in illusions.
Let's untangle this mess of misunderstanding of an ignorant.
The most entangled, and by a large lead.
A false teachings that crept into church during its infant stage.
Very nice write up, informative and to the point.

To fence off the house with a wall.
It differs markedly from his own account.
I have to root for my team.
They have the gall to question my statement, have the nerve, is a brazen boldness with brash and insolent self-confidence.
He often prioritises personal rapport with his staff and is expected to place considerable stock in the in-person meetings, has confidence or faith in such meetings.
This is why it was made up so frivolously and accepted all throughout its history.
It has an underlying philosophy.
Opinions which sharply conflict with my views.
To provide a sanitised and harmonised version of the early years.
Such a shameless liar.
To have reasons to prosecute war.
It spiralled into a conundrum, the situation quickly got worse.
Can we have some sanity back?
It was the final nail in the coffin.
The policies were not all that thought out.
No one piece of evidence states that, in straightforward and unambiguous language.
You can start much smaller. No one eats an elephant in one dinner.
Speak to fill the void.
Drink water straight from the tap.
We are set to pull the plug on the project.
He declined to comment on the report.

We are fortunate to have this letter, because it is from it that we learn most about the details.
It's up for debates.
An ill concealed laughter.
Be served by obsequious waiters, servile, sycophantic, excessively obedient and overly attentive.
Obsessed to satiate its lust for sensationalism.
If the rabble continues to occupy itself with you, then simply don't read that hogwash, but rather leave it to the reptile for whom it has been fabricated.
He had imposed on them a moderate tribute, suitable to their limited resources.
“Unwritten” isn’t quite the way to describe it.
They are trying to stoke hatred, contempt and resentment.
When you knowingly call it so, in full awareness or consciousness, deliberately, as possessing secret knowledge.
Only the locals are entitled to badmouth their country, speak ill of others.
Opportunities like this don't come along every day.
None of this makes sense.

Whenever the circumstances so require.
The person so designated or appointed.
If the court considers that exceptional circumstances so justify.
When adopting such a judgment, the court will have due regard to the sensitive nature of the documents so considered.
If it so decides of its own motion, on its own initiative.
They may raise their claim in so far as its character and the circumstances permit.
The court may at any time examine an adjourned application where the interests of the proper administration of justice so require.
If the presiding judge so directs, the clerk must provide the verbatim record of the hearing.
It shall so declare in a reasoned decision.
If the judge so desires, he may attach an advisory opinion or a separate opinion either concurring with or dissenting from the reasoned decision, or barely statement of dissent.
Failure to do so may lead to the case being struck out of the court's rolls.
Once it has become final.
Once a request for interim measures has been submitted.
Once the time-limit has elapsed, it cannot be extended, as set out in the rules.
Conditions laid down in the next paragraph.
They should be mindful at all times of their duty to act with requisite integrity and dignity, necessary and required.
Persons associated with pending cases.
In the exercise of their functions, they must keep themselves free of undue influence of any kind.
This affects adversely the public confidence in the institution.
To perform their duties in a diligent and respectful manner.
They may not engage in any additional activity except insofar as this is compatible with the prestige of their job.
The dysfunction that has given rise to similar complaints.
I can't call his name to mind, remember, recall.
We are reaching out to tell you about some changes.
Unless mentioned above, these changes will fully take effect on August 26th.
When it waved its final goodbye.
Little we know about it, which means we are left to speculate about it.
It is important to lay out some historical context before we address the points.
Let me lay out some important points, make it explicit.
The dispute we are set to answer is the following.

Now onto the fun part.
I bet he's thinking otherwise.
This is the final straw.
Once we get up to this point.
Where do you think the race stands now?
Drop out of the race after weeks of political tumult, disarray, agitation.
By a quirk, the words happen to resemble each other.
It didn't fall by the wayside, and remained the mainstream.
However, its a bit more complicated than that, so let’s back up a bit.
They wanted to, but he kept them from doing so.
Let me ask you another question to show how dump yours is.
I don’t think the government has delivered on its promises.
The jobs were outsourced to mercenaries.
It's moot, a moot point.
It is premature to conclude that the time is ripe for the adoption of new instruments on this issue.
He is unfit and unqualified for the job.
For the sake of argument, to explore the hypothetical situation.
A very loose umbrella term that doesn't say anything specific.
Behave like a spoilt child.
Their apparent bonhomie, friendliness.
But communicating takes some getting used to.
So that's my two cents on the matter.
This is not a gimmick or marketing tool, not a trick or ruse.
This idea is a bit off.
The author seems to be far too poorly informed about the matters, not someone with firsthand knowledge.
There is an odd theory that goes something like this.
It got me thinking that they systematically disregard risks.
Opportunity knocks.
To sneak by the obstacles, creep through.
With little regard for fairness and equity.
Wounded imperial pride.
I don't have an issue with the word itself.
Abiogenesis, life from non-life.
We could but didn’t pay attention on time.
I am not anywhere near his level.
In fact, it is all fiction, if you excuse the pun, play of words.

On a stylistic note, I would omit this fragment.
They fall short of providing definitive proof.
They were pushed overboard.
Fair Warning: I have absolutely no research to support this answer.
Too fuzzy-edged to qualify as a principle.
Well, this question has summoned a whole bunch of haters.
Before a handful of speakers branched off and began to migrate.
Working in such an uncompetitive market is a real stroke of luck.
That estimate isn't as wide of the mark as it seems, not so far from the truth, inaccurate, not grounded in reality.
"Ad lib", short for "ad libitum," meaning "at one's pleasure", without a script or planning.
We bow to your superior intellect.
Two candidates limp to a runoff, to the second round.
Mist to cover up corruption.
Classic creativity on display here.
Our heartfelt thanks, sincere, genuine.
The political outbursts might bear some of the blame.
Your confusion seems to arise from another misconception.
Bear with me – I have a point.
We've been reminded about it umpteen times.
A swindler paltering with his investors is when you lie by telling the truth in a misleading way.
There is no such thing except in his fervid imagination.
During a dangerous time when science and religion were often pitted against one another.
Nothing in his demeanour suggests that.
Good point, one comment though, if I remember rightly.
Try to get us food.
Of all the things that never happened, this never happened the most.

Yes and No. We'll do the “no” first.
As far as our knowledge goes.
Lower your expectations.
What a time to be alive.
The payment came at his direction, as testified on the witness stand in court.
No long winded explanation.
I strongly suspect that this is a troll question.
It looks and feels like it was shoehorned in as an afterthought.
Let's crack on, continue doing something as quickly as possible.
The review led to the severing of informants' sources.
They used to look down on the immigrants.
The idea caught on.
Then raid the kitchen.
We've come full circle.
You know I pride myself on being reliable.
This is a continually recurring question in different forms.
Its importance can't be overstated.
He was very tired, so much so that he fell asleep immediately.
But they are nothing like at all.
I suggest that before you pursue this question further you check out the facts.
I'd like to express my sympathy to her family and friends, compassion, and condolences.
Which amounts to a lot.
Not a groundbreaking change, but still an intentional change.
He clipped their wings.
He did something unheard of.
If given the chance, which one would you choose?
This advantage is less noticeable in modern environments.
It is slowly getting visibility.
This is a hot contender for the most stupid question ever written.
From among the elites.
Showcasing his mastery of the language.
Not to forget this day is coming up.
They are identical except for size.
The news came just a short while ago.
As for their backwardness, an old myth cooked up by somebody without any basis in fact.
The predators are as intelligent as they need to be to outwit their prey.
The government pushes this to keep us from noticing that they are looting the country.
Two weeks to go.
The country no longer stands by its commitment.
The aura of invincibility around him has been shattered.
The country is currently enmeshed in a leadership crisis stemming from the death of its president last month.
However, this is where the similarities end.
There are things he could have handled better.
After this day, we cannot go on as though nothing has happened.
Here is the breakdown of this concept.
Spot on answer, the answer provided is exactly correct or perfectly accurate, the answer hits the mark without any errors or omissions.
We have room for but one language here.
Continuously exposed to misinformation.
He is an influential figure in his own right.
However, his long-term vision was firmly rooted in the promotion of democratic values and human rights, which often put him at odds with the Soviet model.
He was not supportive of their policies.
I'm still confused as to how the hell they managed to mount a case.
I'm really scratching my head about the answers here.
You are a gullible sucker who fell for the lies of a charlatan. Do better.
Nothing out of the ordinary.

It is not argued, let alone explained.
It was meant to dissuade others from taking part in the conspiracy, discourage, deter.
Corruption comes to mind when you mention this country.
The trump card.
A short attention span refers to a limited ability to focus on a task or topic for an extended period of time.
That lunatic fringe can't contain himself.
You communicate nothing but gibberish.
I have a bummer and they want to drag others into it, unpleasant situation.
Just a word of warning.
A few things spring spontaneously to mind.
He cut me off in the middle of our conversation, stopped me speaking by interrupting me or putting the telephone down.
They continued to plummet into despair.
In my reading, or the way I interpret the text.
Much ado about nothing, when someone is overreacting and makes a big deal of fuss over something unimportant.
A petty hooligan, incapable of providing that their phantasm even exists.
Sorry for keeping bugging you.
This proposal is well thought out, with all consequences considered.
Things worth remembering.
Then the odds decreased markedly.
To prod him towards something, to incite to action, motivate or urge.
The veil has finally come off.
It dents our importance, makes it weaker.
It can pose challenges though.
Being parochial refers to having a narrow or limited outlook, provincial, having limited exposure to ideas and perspectives outside of one's community or environment.
It vanished like a fart in the air of history.
Let’s not quibble over words.
They brush off this idea as unscientific.
No quibble with what you’ve written but let’s not forget the foregoing.
A highly anticipated feature.

The propaganda machine that tolerates no dissent.
One wonders how many more secret reports they have.
There can be no doubt that this is an instrument of repression.
The operations described above, or variants thereof.
Not everything is looking rosy.
He was also an astute observer of human nature.
Don't take offence to my question.
Get in line.
That's quite an imagination you have.
In a sudden spasm of altruism.
Otherwise known as a common human recklessness.
What's your pitch, your concise summary or explanation of your idea, proposal, product, or yourself in a persuasive manner, quick overview of why something is worth considering.
They don't follow the knews closely.
It went into decline.
No one in their right mind thinks it is so.
The complainants must have a vested interest or legal right that is impacted by the matter at hand, and must have pursued all possible avenues for legal recourse within their own country's legal system.

That is what we need to be mindful of, to take into consideration, to pay attention to, be aware of or be cognizant of.
Your question insults the intelligence of the reader.
Geopolitics, natural disasters, health scares or anything else could end up spooking investors.
He was the consummate bureaucratic infighter, perfect bureaucrat, and a toady, sycophant.
Worded in a convoluted way, expressed or phrased in a complicated manner.
Swamped under a deluge of complaints.
These are facts which, alone, are alarming and unprecedented.
I'm coming around to your point of view, start accepting and stop opposing it, or disagreeing with it.
This is a landmark ruling, historical, and it could trigger a wave of similar lawsuits in other countries.
They foment animosity among the members, fuel enmity.
A language is a dialect with an army and a navy, Max Weinreich.
Don't be hasty.
Tellingly, he refused to meet them on his latest trip, which is revealing.
That defies expectations.
What sets them apart defies ordinaries.
Today marks 5 years since he was condemned.
To help in solving the issue.
Killed or maimed, wounded or injured so that part of the body is permanently damaged.
Maybe he is napping.
I didn't find a tactful way to say that.
His arrival was foretold in ancient murals.
Disgusting beyond belief.

Whether it makes things better or worse depends on whom you ask.
In a way, true to a limited extent or in certain respects.
Without caring too much about it.
Are you a gatekeeper?
Selfish, greedy, ambitious, unscrupulous, exactly what is in high demand nowadays.
It operates on the premise that the readers are stupid.
He ended up having to stay in space until further notice.
I've thought long and hard over this.
History is replete with very bad people who wish to take everything away from you.
Talent like yours should not go to waste.
It was unacceptable to hold on to the view that the situation is essentially unalterable.
You touched on an important point, mentioned briefly.
He has already rushed to "express concern" over their reaction.
They amp up propaganda, intensify, increase, the campaign ramped up.
I didn't even bother to mention it.
But several factors made catastrophe all but inevitable.
I fear that I would give offense to the those present no matter what I said.
They look very well fed, barely able to fit on the sofa.
He showed us into the conference room.
We have been shown the real intentions.
It’s amazing how you so nonchalantly cast off an entire era.

People often fret for no rational reason.
Just checking in to see if you're feeling well.
When you lay hands on the files, get possession of them.
The state machine quickly sprang into action.
It is fine by me, I have no objection.
I want to pick up on the conversation we had, return to a point that has already been mentioned or discussed.
They lie through their teeth, telling what they know is a complete lie.
To segue from an episode to the next one, to pass.
They may be spared the cost and inconvenience of such a procedure.
The process can be time-consuming and error-prone.
I don't say this to brag.
Cancelled until further notice.
In plain terms, the only thing he is good at is exposing his accomplices.
We are short on time.
Take activated charcoal before drinking alcohol to minimise unwanted hangovers.
Biggest hugs, kisses and cuddles.
As a refresher, the bond is fraying.
It's time to report to duties.
I don’t know where you find the patience to field all the foolish – also tendentious – questions that you calmly and magisterially answer.
In part, to lay claim over the territory.
The authenticity is doubtful, so it should be read with care.
You mind not talking until I finish?
That escalated quickly.
The observer modifies the observed.
Lie upon lie. I'm in tears.
We have been dragging on for too long with debates, which continue for an excessively long time.
We are raring to go, very eager to do something, but progress has stalled since then.

An uncalled-for display of temper, unnecessary, unprovoked, gratuitous.
He looks unhinged, mentally unbalanced, deranged.
When you imagine him, you likely conjure the image of a poised (balanced) man full of rambunctious (uncontrolled) quirks.
He later penned a note on that topic.
Worth noting is that the data are largely irrelevant.
People often fret for no rational reason, worry, feel uneasy.
He was to rise to prominence and faced accusations of financial impropriety, behaviour that is dishonest, socially unacceptable, or unsuitable for a particular situation, failure to observe standards of honesty or modesty.
It's too long of a story to tell right now.
The story doesn't fit the narrative.
I doubt they know anything of the sort.
The impending lawsuits, in the forthcoming period.
It has already hit the Internet.
He will high likely become the new shareholder.
This is exactly what I've been harping on.
I catch the drift, or I get the drift, understand the general meaning of what someone Is saying.
This matter is of no concern to us.
Time will tell how it is going to play out, to unfold, to manifest itself.
A war with no end in sight.
What do you make of it?
To come to grips with it, to make an effort to understand and deal with a problem or situation.
It’s out of a cold calculation.
Do you take the threats at face value?
Don't twitch, jerk.
The negotiators were nearing an agreement.
He will strike wherever weakness presents, whenever the opportunity presents or arises.
Was it worse the wait?
Shifting the society to military footing.

Opposite to the expected, to the anticipated.
Sorry to rain on your parade.
History is far too kind to this criminal.
As his occasional explanatory digressions show.
Your persistence will pay off down the road, in the future. Don't ease up, don't relax.
Don't ease up on legal documentation just because you're working with a family member.
Offhand, without taking time for careful consideration, I have no idea how you'd go about writing an appeal.
An offhand solution to fix the problem.
You pick on the semantics.
You pick on me, treat me unfairly by blaming and criticising.
What do you make of it? What is your impression, what do you think of it, what is your understanding about this?
Not uncommon in this sort of crimes.
A smug look on your face, complacent.
They are readying themselves to do it.
The backsliding has gone unchecked for too long.
And in most cases they are still fully allegiant to that country.
A dependant, someone who cannot fully provide for themselves due to age, disability, or other circumstances.
Or better yet, it has become plain that it cannot exist.
Bad behaviour is a sure-fire way of getting attention, certain to succeed.
He dons the crown, puts it on.

Truth to be told.
The fatigue sets in.
It should be taken seriously.
Although initially delighted, I started to develop a sneaking suspicion that they had been connected to the scam.
My top three rants about it.
We are still ranting on about the unfairness of it all, speaking or shouting at length in an angry, impassioned way.
I will see you off with great pleasure.
A face contorted with fury.
He is a role model, someone who is worthy of imitation.
We hold them in esteem.
The ink was barely dry before they began to undermine those rights.
He is an acquaintance of mine.
Here's a breakdown.
I bet you didn’t know that.
We can rise to the challenge, react to a difficult situation by working hard to succeed, show that we can deal with the situation, rise to the occasion.


Subject: Pleading of Innocence l

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I hope this letter finds you well.

[Or I write with my deep concerns about…]

I am writing to plead my innocence in the matter of [Case/File Number]. I firmly believe that I have been wrongly accused, and I would like to present my case to seek justice and clear my name.

I want to emphasise that I have the utmost respect for the legal process and the importance of truth and justice. However, the circumstances surrounding the accusations against me have been deeply distressing and have caused immense hardship for me and my loved ones. It is with great sincerity and faith in the fairness of the legal system that I present my plea for your consideration.

I firmly maintain my innocence and would like to bring to your attention several key points that support my claim:

1. Lack of Evidence: There is a distinct absence of concrete evidence linking me to the alleged offence. The prosecution's case is primarily based on circumstantial evidence, which fails to establish a definitive connection between me and the crime in question. I believe that a thorough examination of the evidence will reveal the lack of any substantial proof against me.

2. Inconsistencies and Discrepancies: I have identified several inconsistencies and discrepancies in the accounts provided by the prosecution's witnesses. These inconsistencies raise significant doubts about the accuracy and reliability of their testimonies. I request a careful evaluation of these discrepancies to ensure a fair assessment of the situation.

3. Alibi and Witnesses: I have a strong alibi supported by multiple credible witnesses who can verify my whereabouts during the time in question. These individuals are willing to provide sworn statements and testify under oath to substantiate my claim of innocence. I urge you to consider their testimony as it strengthens my case and undermines the credibility of the accusations against me.

4. Character References: I have lived an honest and law-abiding life, and I have a strong reputation within my community. I have never been involved in any criminal activities before, and those who know me well can attest to my character and integrity. I kindly request you to consider the testimony of character references who can vouch for my good moral standing.

5. Forensic Analysis: I firmly believe that a comprehensive forensic analysis of the evidence will support my innocence. I respectfully request that a thorough examination of the available forensic data be conducted, including DNA analysis, fingerprint analysis, or any other relevant scientific methods, to shed light on the truth of the matter.

I understand that the legal process can be complex and time-consuming, but I implore you to give careful consideration to the points I have raised. My hope is that by thoroughly examining the evidence and testimonies presented, the truth will prevail, and I will be acquitted of all charges brought against me.

I am fully prepared to cooperate with the authorities, attend any required hearings, and provide any additional information or evidence that may aid in my defence. I have complete faith in the fairness of the justice system and trust that my plea will be given the attention it deserves.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to a fair and just resolution to this matter. Please feel free to contact me if you require any further information or if there are any updates regarding my case.

Yours sincerely, [...]

The diverse array of topics that will be discussed over the course of this event will undoubtedly offer invaluable insights, inspire new perspectives, and foster transformative ideas.

Moreover, this conference serves as an embodiment of the spirit of collaboration. As we come together from different corners of the globe, we bring with us a multitude of perspectives, experiences, and expertise. It is within this diverse tapestry that we find the power to ignite change, to unlock the mysteries of the universe, and to shape a future that is not only scientifically advanced but also ethically responsible and sustainable.

Throughout this conference, we encourage you to actively engage with your fellow scientists, researchers, and innovators. Take advantage of this unique opportunity to build connections, forge new partnerships, and establish a network that will endure long after the conference concludes. It is through these collaborations that we can collectively make a profound impact and accelerate progress towards a better world.

As we embark on this journey together, let us embrace the spirit of curiosity, open-mindedness, and intellectual rigour. Let us challenge existing paradigms, explore uncharted territories, and strive for excellence in everything we do. By sharing our knowledge, expertise, and passion for science, we hold the power to transform lives, transcend boundaries, and unravel the mysteries of our universe.

Once again, I extend my warmest welcome to all the distinguished guests, speakers, and participants present today. May this conference be a source of inspiration, a catalyst for innovation, and a testament to the immense power of scientific collaboration. Together, let us push the frontiers of knowledge, shape the future, and leave a lasting impact on generations to come.

Thank you, and I wish you all a fruitful and memorable experience at the Conference.

I was frankly appalled.
Get everything wrong.
I must not pretend to remember everything perfectly.
Notice other oddities.
This seemed servile, apart from anything else.
It ignited my interest.
I experienced a stab of sheer indignation.
I had just been given a glimpse.
It misrepresents the origins.
Grounded on wish-thinking.
The pursuit of ideas for their own sake.
Unfilled gaps.
By evidence and reasoning and not by mutual excommunication.

Raise an eyebrow.
Proclaim our rectitude, wallow in our unworthiness, ostentatious absurdity.
In pursuit of truth or beauty.
Laughably ignorant.
Forced to rescind one of those dogmas, revoke, cancel.
Warn against painkilling effects.
It has to be conceded.
I don’t feel arrogant enough to exempt myself from the mildest self-criticism.
Infancy of our species.
Hard-won human attainments.
Obey the rules and commandments that qualify for an eternity of bliss and repose.
The level of intensity fluctuates according to time and place.
They did so for two excellent reasons.

Or stay out altogether.
Straight yes/no question.
Our own faculties of discernment.
It was in this wise.
Always impending tempests of hatred and bigotry.
Not one single minute of breathing space was allowed.
Set at naught if induced, disregarded, disdained.
To adopt such a stand is the elementary duty of a self-respecting human.
Revert to atavistic behaviour under the least provocation, a prudent rule.
Imagine a greater affront.

This episode, part horrifying and part grotesque, difficult to reconcile.
A number of serious attempts were made.
Bows the knee.
Forfeited their right to exist.
Paramount, as it happens, forced this point.
So ghastly had been the regime, terrible, horrible, frightful.
The disappointment was, and to me remains, acute, as a national disgrace, in most lenient terms.
Who complained about this flat-out hysteria.
The motive to it is laudable.

But is it not safer to adhere to a right principle.
Either subversive or insane.
Opposed the effort to remove hybrids.
In this respect, religion is not unlike racism.
They breed like rabbits and wipe their bottoms with the wrong hand.
Perused but failed to notice.
Crammed together in sties, pigs tend to act swinishly.
It is not unknown for them to eat their own young.
Display many signs of intelligence.
I daresay that it is easy to surmise which came first.
To avoid it altogether.

But many otherwise intelligent mammals.
To press this a little further, one may note that.
They did not sicken from eating pork.
Another answer to the conundrum.
I claim my own solution.
Have a repressed desire to participate.
Those who have been fortunate enough to visit Spain.
The grim origin of these lies.
The ancient stupidity of zealots is upon us again.
Read enough to know of it.
This apparently trivial fetish shows how religion and faith and superstition distort our whole picture of the world.
In the plain light of reason.
Because the drops have to be administered twice.
Inflict the greatest possible suffering in the least number of words.
He has opined that, has been no better and sometimes worse.
Generous enough to point it out.
The vaccine could ward off smallpox, alienate, avert.
Regarded it as an interference with god’s design.
Leave aside the fundamental absurdity of this observation.
As they might have liked to believe.
In doing so, it continues to pose an urgent threat, I pose a hypothetical question.
For all I care.
This revulsion is innate in any healthy person, disgust.
This salient fact claims a special divine exemption for its practices and beliefs.
Do without bothering to consult him.
He has been lavish in his promise.
Deranged fantasies from the bill of indictment.
Inescapable dilemma.
Cheap thrill of impending doom.
The wish for obliteration can be seen without disguise.
I second his motion, support.
Confrontation with reason.
One must state it plainly.

The power to dictate its own terms.
The pathetic vestiges of this can still be seen.
The world of the living contains enough visible and tangible marvels and mysteries.
