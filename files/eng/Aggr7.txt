Yes and No. We'll do the no first.
The payment came at his direction, as testified on the witness stand in court.

It is not argued, let alone explained.
It was meant to dissuade others from taking part in the conspiracy, discourage, deter.
Corruption comes to mind when you mention this country.
The trump card.
A short attention span refers to a limited ability to focus on a task or topic for an extended period of time.
That lunatic fringe can't contain himself.
You communicate nothing but gibberish.
I have a bummer and they want to drag others into it, unpleasant situation.
Just a word of warning.
A few things spring spontaneously to mind.
He cut me off in the middle of our conversation, stopped me speaking by interrupting me or putting the telephone down.
They continued to plummet into despair.
In my reading, or the way I interpret the text.
Much ado about nothing, when someone is overreacting and makes a big deal of fuss over something unimportant.
A petty hooligan, incapable of providing that their phantasm even exists.
Sorry for keeping bugging you.
This proposal is well thought out, with all consequences considered.
Things worth remembering.
Then the odds decreased markedly.
To prod him towards something, to incite to action, motivate or urge.
The veil has finally come off.
It dents our importance, makes it weaker.
It can pose challenges though.
Being parochial refers to having a narrow or limited outlook, provincial, having limited exposure to ideas and perspectives outside of one's community or environment.
It vanished like a fart in the air of history.
Let’s not quibble over words.
They brush off this idea as unscientific.
No quibble with what you’ve written but let’s not forget the foregoing.

The propaganda machine that tolerates no dissent.
One wonders how many more secret reports they have.
There can be no doubt that this is an instrument of repression.
The operations described above, or variants thereof.
Not everything is looking rosy.
He was also an astute observer of human nature.
Don't take offence to my question.
Get in line.
That's quite an imagination you have.
In a sudden spasm of altruism.
Otherwise known as a common human recklessness.
What's your pitch, your concise summary or explanation of your idea, proposal, product, or yourself in a persuasive manner, quick overview of why something is worth considering.
They don't follow the knews closely.
It went into decline.
No one in their right mind thinks it is so.
The complainants must have a vested interest or legal right that is impacted by the matter at hand, and must have pursued all possible avenues for legal recourse within their own country's legal system.

That is what we need to be mindful of, to take into consideration, to pay attention to, be aware of or be cognizant of.
Your question insults the intelligence of the reader.
Geopolitics, natural disasters, health scares or anything else could end up spooking investors.
He was the consummate bureaucratic infighter, perfect bureaucrat, and a toady, sycophant.
Worded in a convoluted way, expressed or phrased in a complicated manner.
Swamped under a deluge of complaints.
These are facts which, alone, are alarming and unprecedented.
I'm coming around to your point of view, start accepting and stop opposing it, or disagreeing with it.
This is a landmark ruling, historical, and it could trigger a wave of similar lawsuits in other countries.
They foment animosity among the members, fuel enmity.

Tellingly, he refused to meet them on his latest trip, which is revealing.
That defies expectations.

Today marks 5 years since he was condemned.
To help in solving the issue.
Killed or maimed, wounded or injured so that part of the body is permanently damaged.
Maybe he is napping.
I didn't find a tactful way to say that.
His arrival was foretold in ancient murals.
Disgusting beyond belief.

Whether it makes things better or worse depends on whom you ask.
In a way, true to a limited extent or in certain respects.
Without caring too much about it.
Are you a gatekeeper?
Selfish, greedy, ambitious, unscrupulous, exactly what is in high demand nowadays.
It operates on the premise that the readers are stupid.
He ended up having to stay in space until further notice.
I've thought long and hard over this.
History is replete with very bad people who wish to take everything away from you.
Talent like yours should not go to waste.
It was unacceptable to hold on to the view that the situation is essentially unalterable.
You touched on an important point, mentioned briefly.
He has already rushed to "express concern" over their reaction.
They amp up propaganda, intensify, increase, the campaign ramped up.
I didn't even bother to mention it.
But several factors made catastrophe all but inevitable.
I fear that I would give offense to the those present no matter what I said.
They look very well fed, barely able to fit on the sofa.
He showed us into the conference room.
We have been shown the real intentions.
It’s amazing how you so nonchalantly cast off an entire era.

People often fret for no rational reason.
Just checking in to see if you're feeling well.
When you lay hands on the files, get possession of them.
The state machine quickly sprang into action.
It is fine by me, I have no objection.
I want to pick up on the conversation we had, return to a point that has already been mentioned or discussed.
They lie through their teeth, telling what they know is a complete lie.
To segue from an episode to the next one, to pass.
They may be spared the cost and inconvenience of such a procedure.
The process can be time-consuming and error-prone.
I don't say this to brag.
Cancelled until further notice.
In plain terms, the only thing he is good at is exposing his accomplices.

I don’t know where you find the patience to field all the foolish – also tendentious – questions that you calmly and magisterially answer.
In part, to lay claim over the territory.
The authenticity is doubtful, so it should be read with care.
You mind not talking until I finish?
That escalated quickly.
The observer modifies the observed.
Lie upon lie. I'm in tears.
We have been dragging on for too long with debates, which continue for an excessively long time.
We are raring to go, very eager to do something, but progress has stalled since then.

An uncalled-for display of temper, unnecessary, unprovoked, gratuitous.
He looks unhinged, mentally unbalanced, deranged.
When you imagine him, you likely conjure the image of a poised (balanced) man full of rambunctious (uncontrolled) quirks.
He later penned a note on that topic.
Worth noting is that the data are largely irrelevant.
People often fret for no rational reason, worry, feel uneasy.
He was to rise to prominence and faced accusations of financial impropriety, behaviour that is dishonest, socially unacceptable, or unsuitable for a particular situation, failure to observe standards of honesty or modesty.
It's too long of a story to tell right now.
The story doesn't fit the narrative.
I doubt they know anything of the sort.

This is exactly what I've been harping on.
I catch the drift, or I get the drift, understand the general meaning of what someone Is saying.
This matter is of no concern to us.
Time will tell how it is going to play out, to unfold, to manifest itself.
A war with no end in sight.
What do you make of it?
To come to grips with it, to make an effort to understand and deal with a problem or situation.
It’s out of a cold calculation.
Do you take the threats at face value?
Don't twitch, jerk.

Your persistence will pay off down the road, in the future. Don't ease up, don't relax.
Don't ease up on legal documentation just because you're working with a family member.
Offhand, without taking time for careful consideration, I have no idea how you'd go about writing an appeal.
An offhand solution to fix the problem.
You pick on the semantics.
You pick on me, treat me unfairly by blaming and criticising.
What do you make of it? What is your impression, what do you think of it, what is your understanding about this?
Not uncommon in this sort of crimes.
A smug look on your face, complacent.
They are readying themselves to do it.
The backsliding has gone unchecked for too long.
And in most cases they are still fully allegiant to that country.
A dependant, someone who cannot fully provide for themselves due to age, disability, or other circumstances.
Or better yet, it has become plain that it cannot exist.
Bad behaviour is a sure-fire way of getting attention, certain to succeed.
He dons the crown, puts it on.

Truth to be told.
The fatigue sets in.
It should be taken seriously.
Although initially delighted, I started to develop a sneaking suspicion that they had been connected to the scam.
My top three rants about it.
We are still ranting on about the unfairness of it all, speaking or shouting at length in an angry, impassioned way.
I will see you off with great pleasure.
A face contorted with fury.
He is a role model, someone who is worthy of imitation.
We hold them in esteem.
The ink was barely dry before they began to undermine those rights.
He is an acquaintance of mine.
Here's a breakdown.
I bet you didn’t know that.
We can rise to the challenge, react to a difficult situation by working hard to succeed, show that we can deal with the situation, rise to the occasion.


Subject: Pleading of Innocence l

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I hope this letter finds you well.

[Or I write with my deep concerns about…]

I am writing to plead my innocence in the matter of [Case/File Number]. I firmly believe that I have been wrongly accused, and I would like to present my case to seek justice and clear my name.

I want to emphasise that I have the utmost respect for the legal process and the importance of truth and justice. However, the circumstances surrounding the accusations against me have been deeply distressing and have caused immense hardship for me and my loved ones. It is with great sincerity and faith in the fairness of the legal system that I present my plea for your consideration.

I firmly maintain my innocence and would like to bring to your attention several key points that support my claim:

1. Lack of Evidence: There is a distinct absence of concrete evidence linking me to the alleged offence. The prosecution's case is primarily based on circumstantial evidence, which fails to establish a definitive connection between me and the crime in question. I believe that a thorough examination of the evidence will reveal the lack of any substantial proof against me.

2. Inconsistencies and Discrepancies: I have identified several inconsistencies and discrepancies in the accounts provided by the prosecution's witnesses. These inconsistencies raise significant doubts about the accuracy and reliability of their testimonies. I request a careful evaluation of these discrepancies to ensure a fair assessment of the situation.

3. Alibi and Witnesses: I have a strong alibi supported by multiple credible witnesses who can verify my whereabouts during the time in question. These individuals are willing to provide sworn statements and testify under oath to substantiate my claim of innocence. I urge you to consider their testimony as it strengthens my case and undermines the credibility of the accusations against me.

4. Character References: I have lived an honest and law-abiding life, and I have a strong reputation within my community. I have never been involved in any criminal activities before, and those who know me well can attest to my character and integrity. I kindly request you to consider the testimony of character references who can vouch for my good moral standing.

5. Forensic Analysis: I firmly believe that a comprehensive forensic analysis of the evidence will support my innocence. I respectfully request that a thorough examination of the available forensic data be conducted, including DNA analysis, fingerprint analysis, or any other relevant scientific methods, to shed light on the truth of the matter.

I understand that the legal process can be complex and time-consuming, but I implore you to give careful consideration to the points I have raised. My hope is that by thoroughly examining the evidence and testimonies presented, the truth will prevail, and I will be acquitted of all charges brought against me.

I am fully prepared to cooperate with the authorities, attend any required hearings, and provide any additional information or evidence that may aid in my defence. I have complete faith in the fairness of the justice system and trust that my plea will be given the attention it deserves.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to a fair and just resolution to this matter. Please feel free to contact me if you require any further information or if there are any updates regarding my case.

Yours sincerely, [...]

I was frankly appalled.
Get everything wrong.
I must not pretend to remember everything perfectly.
Notice other oddities.
This seemed servile, apart from anything else.
It ignited my interest.
I experienced a stab of sheer indignation.
I had just been given a glimpse.
It misrepresents the origins.
Grounded on wish-thinking.
The pursuit of ideas for their own sake.
Unfilled gaps.
By evidence and reasoning and not by mutual excommunication.

Raise an eyebrow.
Proclaim our rectitude, wallow in our unworthiness, ostentatious absurdity.
In pursuit of truth or beauty.
Laughably ignorant.
Forced to rescind one of those dogmas, revoke, cancel.
Warn against painkilling effects.
It has to be conceded.
I don’t feel arrogant enough to exempt myself from the mildest self-criticism.
Infancy of our species.
Hard-won human attainments.
Obey the rules and commandments that qualify for an eternity of bliss and repose.
The level of intensity fluctuates according to time and place.
They did so for two excellent reasons.

Or stay out altogether.
Straight yes/no question.
Our own faculties of discernment.
It was in this wise.
Always impending tempests of hatred and bigotry.
Not one single minute of breathing space was allowed.
Set at naught if induced, disregarded, disdained.
To adopt such a stand is the elementary duty of a self-respecting human.
Revert to atavistic behaviour under the least provocation, a prudent rule.
Imagine a greater affront.

This episode, part horrifying and part grotesque, difficult to reconcile.
A number of serious attempts were made.
Bows the knee.
Forfeited their right to exist.
Paramount, as it happens, forced this point.
So ghastly had been the regime, terrible, horrible, frightful.
The disappointment was, and to me remains, acute, as a national disgrace, in most lenient terms.
Who complained about this flat-out hysteria.
The motive to it is laudable.

But is it not safer to adhere to a right principle.
Either subversive or insane.
Opposed the effort to remove hybrids.
In this respect, religion is not unlike racism.
They breed like rabbits and wipe their bottoms with the wrong hand.
Perused but failed to notice.
Crammed together in sties, pigs tend to act swinishly.
It is not unknown for them to eat their own young.
Display many signs of intelligence.
I daresay that it is easy to surmise which came first.
To avoid it altogether.

But many otherwise intelligent mammals.
To press this a little further, one may note that.
They did not sicken from eating pork.
Another answer to the conundrum.
I claim my own solution.
Have a repressed desire to participate.
Those who have been fortunate enough to visit Spain.
The grim origin of these lies.
The ancient stupidity of zealots is upon us again.
Read enough to know of it.
This apparently trivial fetish shows how religion and faith and superstition distort our whole picture of the world.
In the plain light of reason.
Because the drops have to be administered twice.
Inflict the greatest possible suffering in the least number of words.
He has opined that, has been no better and sometimes worse.
Generous enough to point it out.
The vaccine could ward off smallpox, alienate, avert.
Regarded it as an interference with god’s design.
Leave aside the fundamental absurdity of this observation.
As they might have liked to believe.
In doing so, it continues to pose an urgent threat, I pose a hypothetical question.
For all I care.
This revulsion is innate in any healthy person, disgust.
This salient fact claims a special divine exemption for its practices and beliefs.
Do without bothering to consult him.
He has been lavish in his promise.
Deranged fantasies from the bill of indictment.
Inescapable dilemma.
Cheap thrill of impending doom.
The wish for obliteration can be seen without disguise.
I second his motion, support.
Confrontation with reason.
One must state it plainly.

The power to dictate its own terms.
The pathetic vestiges of this can still be seen.
The world of the living contains enough visible and tangible marvels and mysteries.
Emulations of the supplicant serf before an ill-tempered, self-centred and conceited monarch.
I happen to be busy on an errand.
Consult their “stars” and see through the fallacy.
The luckless victim, devourers and devoured.
Equipped with wings.
To echo Laplace.
This vanity allows us to overlook the implacable fact, vain as we are.
Unfettered inquiry, unrestrained or uninhibited.

Those who have yielded, not without a struggle, to the overwhelming evidence.
Award themselves a medal for their own acceptance of defeat.
A tinkerer, an approximator, and a blunderer, in heaping up a junkyard.
The human record is traceable back for an impressively long and continuous period of time.
Well-intentioned as he may have been.
To which I alluded earlier.
Probably the most daunting task that we face.
No less difficult is the realisation that we may also be quite random as presences on earth.
This is no great surprise: inefficient creatures will either die out or be destroyed by more successful ones.
Arrived at the most disquieting and unsettling conclusion.
It may be worth mentioning that.
Most diverse and interesting of conceivable universes.
Shrewdly observed.
Wonders certainly await us.

Though I dislike to differ with such a great man.
On certain very special occasions.
Hopelessly inconsistent, incurable deficiency, sinister premonitions.
Appears to necessitate religious war.
Already littered with existing prophecies.
Most attention has been concentrated on chapter 20 itself.
Dire warning that the sins of the fathers will be visited on their children.
Indiscriminate massacre.

Safely and easily discarded.
Ill-carpentered fiction.
Times prior thereto.
It seems distinctly implausible.
Until well after his death.
Genocidal incitements.
Emissaries, raising afresh the whole question.
Imperatives of nomadic subsistence.
For concision, I shall again defer it to a finer writer.
Palpably apocryphal stories.
Soap-opera.
The movie sought tirelessly to lay the blame for it upon them.
Patently fraudulent claim.
They flatly contradict each other.
A ghastly emanation from sick minds.
Incandescent debate.
Notwithstanding all that, there is scarcely a word in any of the letters.
The bent and stretched evidence had to be massaged to some extent.

Thus prophecy is fulfilled.
A demand that lay well beyond their right.
It is of interest to note the dates of these magnificently ingenious edicts.
This is really so preposterous as to be comic.
An attempt to give the barest suggestion of the meaning of words, minimum, the slightest.
The point may seem minor but it is not.
Sanguinary feuds between different schools.
It naturally goes without saying.
While there was little or no evidence for that.
In ascertainable history.
I owe him an apology for the precedent cases.
Justify such arrogance and presumption.
We need take no side in the schism.
As one might expect, once it is conceded.
Pile hearsay upon hearsay, and purport to describe, if you so choose.
Guilty of a heinous sin.
The insight, to which I am coming.
Thus the likelihood of the second must be weighed against the likelihood of the first.

Nobody seems to have thought it worthwhile to interview either survivor.
To respect ourselves enough to disbelieve the whole thing.
Until superior evidence is presented, which it has not been.
Exceptional claims demand exceptional evidence, asserted at second or third hand.
Made for their benefit.
We grant them the presumption of truth.
The only responsible decision is to suspend or withhold judgment until the votaries have come up with something that is not merely childish, proponents.
I found myself representing the devil, as it were, pro bono.
I myself am absolutely convinced.
He broke silence after a while to say that.
Standing atop the shoulders of distinguished writers and thinkers.

That enabled him to be prescient, not all of the time by any means, but impressively so on some occasions; predictive, clairvoyant.
The thought has surely occurred to many people throughout the ages.
Eloquent in itself, so to say.
Futile as this proceeding was.
He exacted the best possible revenge for his stolen and empty childhood.
Their gullibility and their herd instinct.
It has attracted a great deal of criticism.
To rehearse the conjury.
This remains a fascinating and somewhat open question.
A long-standing condition that vanished from human view.
Metaphors and allegories.
They incited to carry out the pillage and murder of other tribes.
Milder words are not accepted straightaway.
At any rate, the Almighty managed to tolerate the situation.
It would also be inaccurate to say that.
I can do no other.
This sura deals at some length with the justified spoils of war.

It is often portrayed as though it involved a connection between religious belief and ethical outcomes.
He was in a sense pushing at an open door.
To state the matter shortly, it might suit him.
A fakir and guru instead.
Which in the circumstances would have meant much the same thing.
Arrived shortly thereafter.
If only to see what damage he had wrought.
An impulse dependent upon something rather tenuous.
One branch happened to take root and grow.
Travesty of the truth.
Exemplify the same point in a different way.
The protagonist made a very acute observation.
One might prefer to attribute this to another fact.
An obscene and menacing phone calls from him.
I am not overwhelmed by an excess of choice, shivering with fear.
I was helping escort to a place of safety.
Beyond computation.
To my surprise, he did not dismiss my question.
I was impressed by this man’s frankness.
Make no distinction between races and nations.
Slaughtered them en masse.
Take refuge in churches.

Emancipation from Soviet rule.
He was praised among other things for the number of apologies he had made.
To pursue a softer solution.
Blindness of sight.
Shoes and minds must be left at the gate.
Seeking advice and counsel.
Conceivably, some readers of these pages will be shocked to learn of his existence.
There you have it again: a baseless assumption that some undefined external “force” has a mind of its own.
He knows a great deal about all this.
Of this non-sequitur type, a conclusion or statement that does not logically follow from the previous argument or statement.
By way of the dissolution of their own critical faculties, put their reason to sleep, and to discard their minds along with their sandals.
The longer it is delayed the more heinous the denial will become.
The altars of primitive society reeked of blood and vengeful mood.
A short while before I arrived, another atrocity had occurred.
Once grasped is never forgotten, whatever that may mean.
To put it more plainly, for other reasons having nothing to do with reproduction.
In dire need.

It has subsisted largely on lies and fears.
On a whim, in that the dullest mind can grasp.
We don’t want heaven crammed.
To the credit of the institution.
On any subject that the regime chose to define as off-limits.
It had always harboured the most profound misgivings.
One brick piled upon another.
To inaugurate the tenure of another.
Almost negligible.

You may come across a statement purportedly made by him.
It stood squarely across the path.
Praise unreservedly.
The rhetoric is too florid, excessively intricate or complicated.
Which had since been exaggerated beyond all recognition.
Shaman, hooligan and charlatan.
Recourse to much the same tactic.
Gullible yokels, stained glass.
Immutable laws.
Anthropologist would have little difficulty in recognising that.
Endless bounty.
There is nothing in modern secular argument that even hints at any ban.
Backward and despotic state.
Keeping my thoughts to myself.
Divine spark, to a greater or lesser extent.
Away with him!
Deathbed “repentances”.

And he was correct in a formal sense, sniffing this insanitary barbarian, who had a real pang, pain.
Deceiving themselves.
One supposes, rest assured.
Keep abreast of these developments.
The fabrication of a few nonevents.
Another way of putting this is to say that.
It can now only impede and retard, or try to turn back.
Pray in the right direction.
Sacred texts that have been found to be corrupt and confected.
To make it plain to me.
Upright posture.

I ought to salute.
Put me immensely in her debt.
Fraud-buster.
Over many years.
I am very conflicted in this issue.

Arousing resentment, handling complaints.
Get out of a mental rut, track, habit.
That survey revealed new technique of getting along.
It would be out of place.
He was dizzy with fear.
A rollicking story of his achievements, exuberantly lively and amusing.
A vivid illustration of how leadership gravitates to the person who can talk, a shortcut to distinction.
When afire with enthusiasm.
Far-flung corners of the earth.
An erstwhile cowboy, former, old, one-time.
With great gusto, enjoyment, zest.
He longed to go back to college.
An idea that is boiling and stewing within.
Most of them were deadly dull, boring.
The temerity to write.
Fair questions.

I was sorely in need of such training myself.
I am appalled at my own frequent lack of finesse and understanding.
This success is due to one’s technical knowledge.
In the heyday of his activity.
It has escaped my attention up to the present writing.
They searched diligently for a practical textbook on the subject and found not one. 
I recall that we read over one hundred biographies.
To illustrate, the listeners to go out and test.
People are frequently astonished at the new results they achieve.

One man was so stirred by a talk on these principles that he sat far into the night discussing them with other members of the class.
Which he habitually fails to use, as those dormant and unused assets.
You aren’t then a little better equipped to meet life’s situations.
For the heart aim of education.
Unless you have this one fundamental requisite.
Then you can achieve wonders.
Picture to yourself how their mastery will aid you in leading a richer, fuller, happier and more fulfilling life.
My sense of worth depends to no small extent upon my skill in dealing with people.
First to get a bird's eye view of it.
Merely for entertainment.
In the long run, this will mean saving time and getting results.

Skimming through it once will suffice.
The improvement that still lies in the offing, the more distant part of the sea in view.
This sticks in your mind.
You will probably find it difficult to apply.
It is frequently easier to find fault than to find praise.
I’ll put it in his own words as accurately as I can remember.
As the years passed, these blunders became less frequent.
Check up each week on the progress you are making.
Keep notes in the back of this book.
That would do nobody any harm.
Stoutly maintaining that they should never have been imprisoned at all, with courage and determination.
Criticism is futile because it puts a person on the defensive and usually makes them strive to justify themselves.
It often incurs resentment.
As much as we thirst for approval, we dread condemnation.
It will be prolonged indefinitely.
The rebukes almost invariably end in futility.
Handle the problem.
He never troubled to answer the letter.
I am ashamed to admit it.
Became so diplomatic, so adroit at handling people, clever or skilful.
I will speak ill of no man.
Tears streamed down his face.
What is it you want?
I expected too much of youth.
It breeds sympathy, tolerance and kindness.
But these crude methods have sharply undesirable repercussions.

As the desire for food or sleep, which is seldom gratified.
Longing to be appreciated.
These prizes gave him a feeling of importance.
Rockefeller amassed millions that he never spent.
But life blasted all her hopes.
Words that ought to be cast in eternal bronze and hung in every home and school.
I once succumbed to the fad of fasting and went for six days and nights without eating.
There is nothing I need so much as nourishment for my self-esteem.
To resort to flattery so cheap and false that it can be spotted almost before it is out of the mouth.
Be lavish in your praise.
Personally I am very fond of strawberries and cream, but I have found that for some strange reason, fish prefer worms.
It was necessary to bait the hook to suit the fish.
Inasmuch as you have done it.

Action springs out of what we fundamentally desire.
Who pose as experts in the arts.
We solicit your cooperation toward overcoming the undesirable effects arising from late receipt.
It had the reverse effect.
Please don’t trouble to answer this note.
I chanced to meet a real-estate operator.
He didn't object.
In that book he relates an illuminating incident.
Genuinely interested in it.
In tones that bespeak how pleased you are.
He loaded me down with facts, figures, reports and correspondence.

It is a two-way street – both parties benefit.
Until I finally fell asleep.
The boredom and tension were converted into a pleasant and enjoyable experience.
An insincere grin, smile broadly, especially in an unrestrained manner and with the mouth open.
You can be assured, I am still answering my phone with a smile.
I am now trying to see the other person’s viewpoint.
It depends on inner conditions.
But remember, perusing it won’t do you any good unless you apply it.
For its benefits.
He developed an uncanny ability for remembering people’s names.
People are so proud of their names that they strive to perpetuate them at any cost.
It is a mystery to me.
He went to even further pains, careful efforts.
And then tear up the paper.
And sympathised with his grievance.
It vanished into thin air.
I listened patiently to all he had to say.
When he finally simmered down, became less angry, and got in a receptive mood.
Sympathetic listener to whom he could unburden himself.
What did you want to get out of him?

Do unto others as you would have others do unto you.
As I stood there pondering what to do.
A great silence ensued.
Because we have shown respect for her.
The unvarnished truth is that almost all the people you meet feel themselves superior to you in some subtle way.
He craved little recognition.
Sleeping in his clothes for seventy-two hours at a stretch.
But we were guests at a festive occasion.
Before becoming argumentative, given to expressing divergent or opposite views.
His argument full of holes and prove that he is non compos mentis, insane, in law, not competent to go to trial.
By loudly asserting his authority.
That’s tantamount to saying the opposite.
Any of our assumptions leads us to seek every manner of excuse for clinging to it.
A policeman itching to show his authority.

But instead of breaking lances with him.
Not worth worrying about.
It ended without any ill feeling or rancour.
This may perhaps be worth thinking of.
Not going to lead to a satisfactory resolution of my problems.
Succeed in capturing the attention for our ultimate proposal.
He flatly refused to answer.
Why? I asked in amazement.
They will feel inferior and envious.
A formula that will work wonders for you.
A sympathetic grasp of the other persons’ viewpoint.
Make the other person listen attentively.
Feel sorry for the poor devils. Pity them. Sympathise with them.

Illustration of how he softened the ire of a disappointed and ambitious mother.
Was it worth the risk?
Instead he chose to make his point indirectly.
You’ll disgrace yourself if you ever read that stuff.
He realised he had made a grave mistake.
I shall punch him in the nose.
Rightfully used, they will work veritable miracles in human relations.
By letting him save face.
Spur people on to success.
Because he had singled out a specific accomplishment, rather than just making general flattering remarks.
When the facts warrant a change, justify or necessitate.
And he fulfilled her duties satisfactorily from then on.
