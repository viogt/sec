* Orchestrated by and to the benefit of the culprit.

A. Right and access to a court: * litigants should have an effective judicial remedy enabling them to assert their civil rights * brought before a court or tribunal. * a  right that is practical and effective

B. Waiver: An individual cannot be deemed to have waived a right if he or she had no knowledge of the existence of the right. * Right to prompt implementation of a final and binding judicial decision * Guarantees against outside pressure

Criteria for assessing impartiality: * a subjective test: behaviour of a particular judge, that is, whether the judge held any personal prejudice or bias in a given case; * an objective test: tribunal, composition, offers sufficient guarantees.

Article 6 breached: * absence of legal certainty * unfair and unequal proceedings * no proper or sufficient reasons for the decisions * violation of the "established by law" requirements (jurisdiction, composition) * right to defence * right to confront prosecution witnesses * improper prosecution * criminal liability limitation period (statute of limitation) * classification of crimes

Fairness: *  Equality of arms is an inherent feature of a fair trial. It requires that each party be given a reasonable opportunity to present his case under conditions that do not place him at a disadvantage vis-Ã -vis his opponent. Equality of arms requires that a fair balance be struck between the parties, and applies to criminal and civil cases. * Subjective test of impartiality: the judge displayed hostility or ill will or has arranged to have a case assigned to himself for personal reasons. * Objective test: concerns hierarchical or other links between the judge and other persons involved in the proceedings which objectively justify misgivings as to the impartiality of the tribunal, and thus fail to meet the Convention standard under the objective test.

Article 6. Right to a fair trial: 1. Everyone is entitled to a hearing
2. Tribunal established by law: composition, impartiality and independence; territorial jurisd. & investigative; breach of the principle of random allocation of cases.
3. Equality of arms and adversarial proceedings: witnesses; essential materials (disclosure of evidence); expertise.

4. Reasoning of judicial decisions: Reasoned decisions oblige judges to base their reasoning on objective arguments, and also preserve the rights of the defence. National courts should indicate with sufficient clarity the grounds on which they base their decision - distortion and misapplication of substantive law and the Code of Criminal Procedure; absence of legal certainty, no proper or sufficient reasons for decisions; improper prosecution; criminal liability limitation period (statute of limitation); classification of crimes; aplicarea retroactiva a legii; decizii pe presupuneri;
Article 13. Right to an effective remedy: Everyone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in this Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authority notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity.
