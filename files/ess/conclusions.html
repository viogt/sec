<br>
in the review procedure opened on 18 January 2021 by the Prosecutor's Office for Combating Organised Crime and Special Cases with respect to both the criminal and civil sides, on the ground that other circumstances were established unknown to the courts when issuing the judgements and which, separately or in conjunction with previously established circumstances, prove the innocence of the convicted person or that he committed a crime less serious than the one for which he was convicted,
<br><br>
<div class='cnt'>it follows:</div>
<br>
<u>IN FACT:</u>
<br><br>
By the sentence of the Buiucani Court of 13.01.2012, Viorel Topa has been found guilty of committing the offence according to Article 191(2) of the Criminal Code. He was sentenced to of 8 (eight) years imprisonment in a closed regime penitentiary. The civil action of “Banca de Economii” S. A. was admitted and it was ordered that the equivalent in lei at the time of execution of the judgment of the sum of 400000 (four hundred thousand) U.S. dollars be collected from Viorel Topa for the benefit of “Banca de Economii” S.A.
<br><br>
By the decision of the Court of Appeal of 10.07.2012, the appeal lodged by lawyer Andrei Nastase in the interests of the defendant Viorel Tudor Topa was rejected as “unfounded” and the sentence of the Buiucani Court of 13.01.2012 was upheld without changes.
<br><br>
Subsequently, by the decision of the Supreme Court of Justice of 14.11.2012, the ordinary recourse against the judgment of the Buiucani Court of 13.01.2012 and the decision of the Court of Appeal of 10.07.2012, lodged by lawyer Andrei Nastase in the interests of the convicted Viorel Tudor Topa, was declared as “inadmissible” and manifestly unfounded. As a result, the sentence of the Buiucani Court of 13.01.2012 became final.
<br><br>
By the decision of the Supreme Court of Justice of 24.10.2013, the recourse in annulment lodged by lawyer Andrei Nastase on behalf of the convicted Viorel Tudor Topa against the decision of the Criminal College of the Supreme Court of Justice of 14 November 2012 was declared “inadmissible”.
<br><br>
By the decision of the Supreme Court of Justice of 07.05.2020, the recourse in annulment lodged by lawyer Pavel Dumitru on behalf of the convicted Viorel Tudor Topa against the decision of the Criminal College of the Supreme Court of Justice of 14 November 14 2012 was declared “inadmissible”.
<br><br>
According to the act of notification and the sentence adopted on the case, Viorel Topa was accused and found guilty of the fact that he, “<i>Viorel Topa, acted as President of the Joint Stock Bank "Banca de Economii" on the basis of the Order no. 153-c, from 26 March 1999 until 23 August 2001, when he resigned. On 11 December 2000, the Credit Committee of BCA “Banca de Economii” received for examination the request of its Chisinau branch BCA “Banca de Economii” regarding the granting to SATI “Air Moldova International” of an ordinary loan in the amount of 1000000 (one million) US dollars, for a period of two years, in order to supplement the working capital of the this company. Based on the content of the minutes no. 181 of the meeting of the Credit Committee of BCA “Banca de Economii”, it was decided to permit to the Chisinau branch of BCA “Banca de Economii” to grant to SATI “Air Moldova International” the ordinary loan in the amount of 1000000 (one million) US dollars, for a period of two years, for the completion of the working capital of the company and the payment of instalments according to the schedule of the respective contracts. At the same time, in order to guarantee the obligation to repay the ordinary loan in the amount of 1000000 US dollars granted to SATI “Air Moldova International” by “Banca de Economii” S.A., on 30 March 2001, the pledge agreement with dispossession no. 93-g between “Banca de Economii” and the offshore company “Sparks Management Corporation” was concluded, according to which, in case of non-fulfilment of the obligation to repay the loan in the amount of 1000000 US dollars, by SATI “Air Moldova International”, the money deposit in the amount of 40000 US dollars, placed in the foreign currency deposit account of the company “Sparks Management Corporation”, was to be used by “Banca de Economii” for the payment of the loan, the related interest and the penalties for non-payment of the loan in the terms established in the credit agreement no. 93 of 11 December 2000, concluded between “Banca de Economii” and SATI “Air Moldova International”. In this context, citizen Viorel Topa, holding the position of President of “Banca de Economii” and, at the same time, de-facto managing the activity of the offshore company “Sparks Management Corporation”, pursuing the purpose of illegally misappropriating money in the amount of US $ 400,000, placed in the foreign currency deposit account of the company “Sparks Management Corporation”, entrusted for administration, knowing with certainty about the pledge of the nominated amount in accordance with the provisions of pledge contract no. 93-g with dispossession of 30.03.2001, as well as about the fact of non-payment by SATI “Air Moldova International” of the obligations to repay the loan obtained in the amount of 1000000 lei, acting contrary to the provisions of point 2.7 of the Regulation on the Credit Committee of the “Banca de Economii”, approved by Council Decision of “Banca de Economii” on 25 February 2000, according to which the Credit Committee is responsible for approving or rejecting the customer’s requests, on 20.08.2001, unipersonally approved the withdrawal of the deposit in the amount of US $ 400000 by the offshore company “Sparks Management Corporation” despite the non-reimbursement by SATI “Air Moldova International” of loan, and as a result “Banca de Economii” S.A. was deprived of the possibility to exercise its right of dispossession of the pledge in the amount of 400000 US dollars, by which he caused to “Banca de Economii” a material damage in the amount of 5150600 lei, which he illegally appropriated through the offshore company “Sparks Management Corporation”</i>.”
<br><br>
Based on the facts stated above, the court held that in law the defendant’s deeds meet the constitutive elements of the offence provided by art.191 paragraph (5) of the Criminal Code, namely, appropriation of another person’s property, meaning the misappropriation of another person’s goods entrusted into the administration of the guilty person, committed by use of an official position and on an especially large scale.

<br><br>
<div class='cnt'><u>ANALYSIS OF THE PROBATORY ENSEMBLE</u></div>
<br>
The conclusion regarding the existence of conditionalities for the criminal prosecution of Viorel Topa for committing the offence provided by art.191 paragraph (5) of the Criminal Code, which follows from the material administered during the review procedure, such as the scrutiny of documents, as well as of the minutes of the criminal prosecution actions carried out:
<br><br>
<div class='cnt'><u>The investigation carried out by the General Prosecutor's Office in 2001</u><br>
regarding the activity of “Banca de Economii” S.A.</div>
<br>
The Financial-Economic Investigation Department of the General Prosecutor's Office, in the person of prosecutor Valentin Casu, examined the materials related to the activity of “Banca de Economii” S.A. on 16 October 2001, in accordance with the provisions of art.5 p.2), art.93 of the Criminal Procedure Code, and issued the Ordinance of <u>refusal to initiate criminal proceedings on the materials related to the activity of “Banca de Economii” S.A., due to the lack of the constitutive elements of an offence in the actions of the persons with positions of responsibility</u>.
<br><br>
<div class='cnt'>Thus, in the descriptive part of the aforementioned Ordinance,<br>
<b>IT WAS ESTABLISHED:</b></div>
<br>
“According to the information presented to the Prosecutor General of the Republic of Moldova, in the period of 19-20 August 2001, the assets of “Banca de Economii” S.A. decreased by approximately MDL 40 million due to the fact that company “Sparks Management Corp” withdrew more deposits in foreign currency in amount of about USD 3 million.
<br><br>
According to the pledge agreements, the respective deposits constituted a guarantee for the allocated credits by “Banca de Economii” S.A. to “Air Moldova” SRL, “Air Moldova International” S.A., Chisinau Mayor’s Office, and “Misdencom” SRL from Chisinau.
<br><br>
The withdrawal of the deposits by company “Sparks Management Corp” ahead of schedule with the consent of the chairman of the bank Mr V. Topa determined the situation that the credits granted to the aforementioned subjects remained unsecured for their reimbursement.
<br><br>
At the same time, the NBM also mentioned the fact that the interest rates for the respective deposits were 2.5-3.5 times greater than the normal rates paid by the “Banca de Economii” S.A. for such deposits.
<br><br>
In its information, the NBM also noted that “Banca de Economii” S.A. incurred expenses for publicity, sponsoring, and organizing events etc. that were not necessary for the bank’s activity, and in 2000 these expenses amounted to MDL 435,000.
<br><br>
In the framework of the inspection, it was stated that according to § 1.4 of the Statute of the “Banca de Economii” S.A., the bank is a financial institution, which accepts from natural persons and legal entities deposits or their equivalents that can be transferred by means of various payment orders; the bank uses these funds integrally or partially to grant credits and to make investments on its own responsibility.
<br><br>
Moreover, according to Article 13 of the Law on financial institutions, the bank has legal, operational, financial and administrative independence towards any person, including the National Bank of Moldova, the Government and other State authorities.
<br><br>
Therefore, in conformity with his duties under §§ 7.11-7.15 of the Statute, the chairman of “Banca de Economii” S.A. V. Topa attracted during 2000-2001 various funds in foreign currency as 23 deposits from the foreign company “Sparks Management Corp” (Bahamas Islands) the total amount of USD 2,725,000 with an annual interest rate of 12%-14.8%.
<br><br>
These funds served as a source for crediting the Chisinau Mayor’s Office, “Air Moldova International”, “Misdencom” SRL and, at the same time, as a guarantee for reimbursement of credits, for the purpose of which the respective pledge agreements were concluded.
<br><br>
At the same time, the pledge agreements provided that company “Sparks Management Corp” could withdraw the pledge before the agreed deadline.
<br><br>
Thus, p. 4.2 of the pledge agreements concluded between “Banca de Economii” S.A. and company “Sparks Management Corp” stipulated that the right of pledge was terminated and the deposit could have been withdrawn within 3 days by the pledgee upon written request in case of force majeure, which also included the case of modification of the composition of the highest bank management. On 17.08.2001 the chairman of “Banca de Economii” S.A., V. Topa, resigned. This fact determined the pledgee on 20.08.2001 to legally withdraw the deposits the amount of USD 2,725,000 and, at the same time, the termination of the bank’s right of pledge.
<br><br>
The clauses stipulated in p. 4.2 of the aforementioned pledge agreements do not contravene to the legislation in force or to the normative acts of the National Bank of Moldova.
<br><br>
At the same time, due to the funds deposited by company “Sparks Management Corp” the bank generated an income amounting to USD 466,981, while the interest paid for the deposits constituted only 255,500 US dollars.
<br><br>
Thus, the bank has not been, and could not be, caused any damage because the allocated credits to the aforementioned economic agents are efficient and continue earning an income to “Banca de Economii” S.A., and the deadline for reimbursement has not yet expired. Moreover, they remained secured with another type of pledge, among which there are airplanes, immovable properties etc.
<br><br>
As to the bank’s activity concerning publicity of the bank’s services, the sponsoring and philanthropic actions, it was stated that there were caused no damage. This was confirmed by the fact that the bank’s budget for year 2000 was approved by both the bank’s Council and by the General Shareholders’ Meeting of “Banca de Economii” S.A.
<br><br>
Moreover, the international audit report carried out by “PriceWaterHouseCoopers” stated that the financial management of the bank, as well as the expenses for publicity, was very efficient.”<br>
<div class='cnt'>/f.p.n.165-167/</div>
<br>
The Ordinance of 16.10.2001 on the refusal to initiate a criminal case, adopted by the prosecutor, Deputy Head of the Financial-Economic Investigations Department of the General Prosecutor's Office, V. Casu, was found in copy in the materials of the Court of Accounts regarding the audit of the Joint Stock Company “Banca de Economii” in the period 01.04.1999-31.12.2001 (Decision of the Court of Accounts no. 56 of 26.06.2002, volume 47/7 - year 2002, page 130-132).
<div class='cnt'>/f.p.n.165-167/</div>
<br>
<div class='cnt'><b>The assessment given by the court to the procedural act of 16.10.2001
(<u>Ordinance of refusal to initiate criminal proceedings</u>), adopted by the
prosecutor, Deputy Head of the Financial-Economic Investigation Department
of the General Prosecutor's Office, V. Casu, whose veracity raised doubts, -</b></div>
<br>
<u>1. Sentence of the Buiucani Court of 13.01.2012:</u>
<br><br>
“…No grounds were established for the release of the defendant from criminal liability, and his requests as well as his defence’s requests regarding the termination of the criminal proceedings due to the Ordinance of the Financial-Economic Investigation Department of the General Prosecutor's Office of 16.10.2011, by which it was refused to initiate criminal proceedings due to the lack of the constitutive elements of an offence in the defendant's actions, issued on the same facts, cannot be admitted, because the said Ordinance cannot serve as evidence for the termination of the criminal proceedings, given that it represents a simple copy, <b>whose authenticity is not confirmed according to the law</b>.”
<br><br>
<u>2. Decision of the Court of Appeal of 10.07.2012:</u>
<br><br>
“…Pursuant to the investigation carried out by the General Prosecutor's Office <b>in order to ascertain the authenticity of the Ordinance of 16.10.2001</b> issued by the ex-prosecutor V. Casu, its non-authentic character was established, as no entry was found in the alphabetical or correspondence registries regarding “Banca de Economii” in relation to Viorel Topa and no verification file was opened in the name of V. Topa or “Banca de Economii” in the Financial-Economic Investigations Department. As a result of those findings, on 19 June 2012, the Department for Exercising the Criminal Investigation in Exceptional Cases of the General Prosecutor's Office initiated the criminal case no. 2012928105 according to Article 332 par.(2) letter b) of the Criminal Code on the fact of forgery of the Ordinance of 16.10.2001 on the refusal to initiate criminal proceedings.
<br><br>
Thus, the Criminal College finds that a photocopy of the Ordinance of 16.10.2001 on the refusal to initiate criminal proceedings, <b>whose authenticity and provenience arouse suspicions and whose veracity could not be demonstrated by the defence</b>, cannot be taken into consideration and cannot constitute a basis for the termination of the criminal proceedings.”
<br><br>
<u>3. Decision of the Supreme Court of Justice of 14.11.2012:</u>
<br><br>
“…Regarding the requests to terminate the criminal proceedings on the grounds of the existence on this fact of an Ordinance of 16.10.2001 on the refusal to initiate criminal proceedings, the Criminal College remarks the lack of grounds to quash the adopted solutions and to order the termination of the criminal proceedings.
First of all, in the case (v.8 f.49) it was ordered to start the criminal investigation on the fact of forging this Ordinance.
Secondly, the legal provisions regarding the Ordinance to refuse in initiating criminal proceedings on the situation of 16.10.2001 are yet to be expounded.
Thirdly, ... Summarising the legal provisions on the legalisation of copies of procedural documents as piece of evidence, the Criminal College concludes the lack of probative value of the photocopy document presented by the defence, dated 16 October 2001, both in examining the case in the first instance, in judging the appeal and examining the admissibility in principle of the recourse.
…For the above reasons, the Criminal College, at the date of examining the admissibility of the recourse, considers the ground invoked as manifestly unfounded and will not engage in the discussion proposed by the appellants about the ordinance to initiate criminal proceedings on the fact of forging of the Ordinance of 16.10.2001.”
<br><br>
<u>4. Decision of the Supreme Court of Justice of 24.10.2013:</u>
<br><br>
“…In truth, according to art.275 p.8) of the Criminal Procedure Code, the criminal investigation cannot be initiated, and if it has been initiated, it cannot be carried out, and will be terminated if there is an unannulled decision not to initiate criminal proceedings or to terminate the criminal proceedings on the same charges in respect of the same person. This provision, as related to art.332 par.(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code, shall result in a solution to terminate the criminal proceedings in the respective case.
<br><br>
However, the Criminal College emphasises that in the present case, in order to exclude the double conviction, <b>it must be established with certainty, without any doubt, the existence of the unannulled decision not to initiate criminal proceedings or to terminate it, regarding the same accusations of the convicted V. Topa</b>.
<br><br>
The author of the recourse in annulment, arguing the need to annul the court decisions based on the Ordinance of 16.10.2001 on the refusal to initiate criminal proceedings, refers to a letter of the General Prosecutor's Office no. 27-87/10-379 of 05.03.2013, which states that such a procedural act was issued by the criminal investigation body.<br><br>
On these grounds, the Criminal College considers that they cannot be taken as a basis for examination by the court of recourse in annulment, given that the <b>document was not the subject of a judicial investigation at least at the level of the Court of Appeal</b>, with the participation of all parties in the criminal proceedings, to whom the right to comment on its content and legality should be ensured.
<br><br>
However, that state of affairs does not limit the right of the defence party in question, including the appellant, to use the procedure for restoring the judicial documents, ...“
<br><br>
<div class='cnt'><u><b>The circumstances unknown to the court when issuing the judgment and which, separately or in conjunction with previously established circumstances, prove the authenticity and existence of the Ordinance of 16.10.2001 on the refusal to initiate criminal proceedings, issued with respect to Viorel Tudor Topa:</b></u></div>
<br>
<u>1. The information issued by the General Prosecutor's Office</u>, in the person of the Deputy General Prosecutor, dated 05.03.2013 no. 24-87/10-379, the content of which stipulates and states, as follows, -
<br><br>
“…The General Prosecutor's Office examined the request, which describes a number of <b>circumstances and ACTS INDICATING TO THE EXISTENCE of materials regarding the examination by the General Prosecutor's Office of the case of diminution of the assets of the “Banca de Economii” after the withdrawal of foreign currency deposits by the company “Sparks Management Corp” on 19-20 August 2001, <u>as well as the Ordinance of refusing in initiating a criminal case, issued by the Deputy Chief Prosecutor of the Financial-Economic Department, Valentin Casu, on 16.10.2001</u>, requesting, at the same time, a certified copy of that ordinance</b>.
<br><br>
In order to identify the respective materials, including the correspondence of the General Prosecutor's Office with the institutions involved in verifying the legality of the withdrawal of deposits by the company “Sparks Management Corp.”, as well as the Ordinance adopted, it was ordered the National Bank of Moldova, “Banca de Economii” S.A., the Court of Accounts and the Secretariat and Audience Department of the General Prosecutor's Office, the verification of all documents kept in their archives, starting from 2001-2002 and referring to the examination of the case.
<br><br>
The incoming/outgoing correspondence registers, which were kept at the respective institutions, were also checked.
<br><br>

The results of the criminal investigation carried out in the criminal case no. 2012928105 initiated on 19.06.2012 by the Department for Exercising the Criminal Investigation on Exceptional Cases of the General Prosecutor's Office based on art.332 par. (2) letter b) of the Criminal Code on the fact of forgery of the Ordinance of 16.10.2001 on the refusal to initiate the criminal case.</u>
<br><br>
Thus, as a result of the criminal investigation carried out in the criminal case no. 2012928105 by the Prosecutor in the Prosecutor's Office for Combating Organised Crime and Special Cases, Sergiu Rosu, the criminal proceedings were terminated on 30.12.2020 based on the provisions of Article 275 point 1) of the Criminal Procedure Code, due to the lack of an offence.
<br><br>
According to the content of the Ordinance of termination of the criminal proceedings in the criminal case no. 2012928105, it is stipulated and STATED, as follows,-
<br><br>
“<i>The criminal investigation in the present case was started on 19.06.2012, by the Department for Exercising the Criminal Investigation on Exceptional Cases of the General Prosecutor's Office, based on reasonable suspicions that an offence provided by Article 332 par. (2), letter b) of the Criminal Code has been committed.
<br><br>
On 19.02.2015, by the ordinance of the prosecutor in the Department for Exercising the Criminal Investigation in Exceptional Cases of the General Prosecutor's Office, Sergiu Rosu, it was ordered to suspend the criminal investigation due to the fact that no person who may be charged was identified, while at that stage all the criminal investigation measures whose execution was possible in the absence of the accused were completed, and all the measures for the identification of the accused were taken, according to Article 2871 par.(1), point 2) of the Criminal Procedure Code.
<br><br>
On 21.12.2020, Prosecutor General Alexander Stoianoglo ordered to resume the investigation of the criminal case in order to carry out criminal prosecution actions.
<br><br>
The criminal investigation established that the prosecutor A. Popenco represented the state accusation on the criminal case of accusing citizen Viorel Tudor Topa, who was accused of committing the offence provided by art.191 par.(5) of the Criminal Code.
<br><br>
During the court hearing on 24.10.2011, the defence lawyer Andrei Nastase, in the interests of the defendant Viorel Topa, presented and requested the court to attach a photocopy of the Ordinance of refusing to initiate the criminal proceedings dated 16.10.2001, issued by the Deputy Head of the Financial-Economic Investigations Department of the General Prosecutor's Office, Valentin Casu, by which it was decided to “refuse the initiation of a criminal case in respect of the materials concerning the activity of “Banca de Economii” S.A. due to lack of constitutive elements of an offence in the deed of a public officer.”
<br><br>
The analysis of the circumstances described in the said Ordinance reveals the fact of the examination of the case related to the withdrawal of the deposit in the amount of US $ 400000 by the offshore company “SPARKS MANAGEMENT CORPORATION” pledged for the purpose of repaying the loan granted to SATI “Air Moldova International”.
<br><br>
Consequently, lawyer Andrei Nastase requested the termination of the criminal proceedings on the ground provided by art.275 point 8) of the Criminal Procedure Code, due to the existence of an unannulled decision not to initiate criminal proceedings on the same charges in respect of the same person.
<br><br>
On 25.10.2011, <b>in order to verify the authenticity of the copy of the Ordinance to refuse in initiating the criminal case issued by prosecutor V. Casu, dated 16.10.2001</b>, an interpellation was submitted to the General Prosecutor's Office of the Financial-Economic Investigation Department, and by the reply no. 24-87/10-2141 of 09.11.2011, the Anticorruption Prosecutor's Office was informed that “according to the information of the Secretariat and Audience Department, no recordings of any documents referring to the actions of the ex-president of “Banca de Economii” S.A., Viorel Topa, were found, neither in the alphabetical file of the chancellery nor in the registers of the Financial-Economic Investigations Department of 2001.
<br><br>
By the sentence of the Buiucani Court of 13 January 2012, citizen Viorel Topa was found guilty of committing the crime provided by art.191 par. (5) of the Criminal Code, being established on the basis of this norm the punishment in the form of imprisonment for a period of 8 (eight) years in a closed penitentiary, with the admission of the civil action of “Banca de Economii” S.A. and the collection from Viorel Topa for the benefit of “Banca de Economii” S.A. of the equivalent in lei at the time of execution of the decision of the amount of 400000 (four hundred thousand) US dollars.
<br><br>
The sentence of the first instance court was challenged by lawyer Andrei Nastase at the Chisinau Court of Appeal, requesting the annulment of the sentence regarding Viorel Topa and the decision of his acquittal.
<br><br>
Having been heard in the Court of Appeal on the circumstances of the appearance of the Ordinance of 16.10.2001 on refusing in initiating the criminal proceedings, witness V. Casu confirmed that he issued the Ordinance on 16.10.2001 as a result of carrying out a verification on the materials that have were submitted by the National Bank of Moldova as a result of the audit performed at that time at “Banca de Economii” S.A.
<br><br>
Witness V. Casu also confirmed that he also examined the fact related to the withdrawal of the deposit in the amount of US $ 400000 by the offshore company “SPARKS MANAGEMENT CORPORATION”, and as a result did not find any violation.

At the same time, at the request of the defence, witness V. Castravet was heard in the Court of Appeal, who stated that during the years 2001-2002 he worked as a prosecutor in the Financial-Economic Investigation Department, and with reference to the authenticity of the Ordinance to refuse in initiating the criminal case dated 16.10.2001, confirmed that such an Ordinance was issued by ex-prosecutor V. Casu, following to a verification of the materials, which were further submitted to the National Bank of Moldova.
<br><br>
Witness V. Castravet made similar statements during the criminal investigation when he was heard as a witness.
<br><br>
Despite these circumstances, by the decision of the Criminal College of the Chisinau Court of Appeal of 10.07.2012, it was ruled to reject the appeal of lawyer A. Nastase in the interests of the defendant V. Topa and to uphold the sentence of the first instance without changes.
<br><br>
During the criminal investigation, witnesses were heard, documents were collected and examined, interpellations were submitted, and other criminal prosecution actions were carried out aiming for the investigation to be complete and objective in all aspects of the circumstances of the case. The documents kept in the archives of the National Bank of Moldova, of “Banca de Economii” S.A., of the Court of Accounts and the Secretariat and Audience Department of the General Prosecutor's Office, starting 2001-2002 and referring to the examination of the case, were checked. The incoming/outgoing correspondence registers, kept at the respective institutions, were also checked</i>.
<br><br>
<b>As a result of the criminal investigation, the following documents were found confirming the examination by the General Prosecutor's Office of the materials regarding the diminution of the assets of “Banca de Economii” S.A. in connection with the withdrawal of foreign currency deposits by SPARKS MANAGEMENT CORPORATION, set out in chronological order, namely:</b><br>
<ul style="list-style-type: '- ';padding-left: .6em;">
<li>the reply letter of “Banca de Economii” S.A. no. 06-01/297 of 10.10.2001 to the request of the General Prosecutor's Office no. 7-43 of 24.09.2001, addressed to Mr V. Castravet, senior prosecutor of the Financial-Economic Investigations Department (the letter exists at “Banca de Economii” S.A. only in copy);
</li>
<li>the decision of the Board of Directors of the National Bank of Moldova no. 287 of 08.11.2001, regarding the results of the audit performed in September-October 2001 at “Banca de Economii” S.A., which mentions at point 3 that the materials will be submitted to the General Prosecutor's Office and the Intelligence and Security Service;
</li>
<li>letter no. 09-02113/213 of 16.11.2001, by which the National Bank of Moldova informed the General Prosecutor's Office and the Intelligence and Security Service about the “Sparks Management Corp” case, attaching at the same time the Report on the thematic audit performed at “Banca de Economii” S.A. on 78 pages;
</li>
<li>letter of the General Prosecutor's Office no. 7-58s/01 of 20.11.2001, signed by the General Prosecutor, Vasile Rusu, requesting the National Bank of Moldova a conclusion regarding the legality of the financial relations of “Banca de Economii” S.A. with “Sparks Management Corp.” and the assessment of the damage caused;
</li>
<li>letter of the National Bank of Moldova no. 09-02213/319 of 07.12.2001 by which the response to the General Prosecutor's Office no. 7-58s/01 of 20.11.2001 was submitted.
</li>
</ul>

It should also be mentioned that the <b>Ordinance of 16.10.2001 of refusing to initiate a criminal case, adopted by the prosecutor, Deputy Head of the Financial-Economic Investigation Department, V. Casu, exists only in copy in the materials of the Court of Accounts regarding the audit of the activity of the Joint Stock Company “Banca de Economii” for 01.04.1999-31.12.2001 (Decision of the Court of Accounts no. 56 of 26.06.2002, volume 47/7 - year 2002, page 130-132)</b>.
<br><br>
This fact is also confirmed by the last answer received from the National Archives Agency, according to which the copy of the Ordinance of 16.10.2001 of refusing to initiate criminal proceedings issued by the prosecutor, Deputy Head of the Financial-Economic Investigation Department, Valentin Casu, is sewn, numbered and sealed, together with other documents, in the materials of the audit performed by the Court of Accounts in 2002.
<br><br>
Accordingly, <b>the existence at least in a copy of the Ordinance, which was alleged to be false, in the materials accumulated by the Court of Accounts on the audit performed in 2002, requires us to consider reasonably that the Ordinance was issued in the period indicated in it and by the prosecutor indicated in it</b>.
<br><br>
Other materials attesting to the examination or the result of the examination of the case by the General Prosecutor's Office were not found, including by the Secretariat and Audience Department of the General Prosecutor's Office, due to the expiration of the limitation period for the storage of documents.
<br><br>
At the same time, it should be mentioned that according to the information presented by the Personnel Department of the General Prosecutor's Office and according to order no. 160-p of 21.02.2001, prosecutor Valentin Casu exercised the position of Deputy Head of the Financial-Economic Investigations Department during 01.02.01-29.11.01.
<br><br>
In the Ordinance dated 16.10.2001 at issue, prosecutor Valentin Casu identifies himself with this position.
<br><br>
According to the information presented by the Personnel Department of the General Prosecutor's Office and according to order no. 749-p of 27.07.2001, prosecutor Valeriu Castravet exercised the function of superior prosecutor in the Financial-Economic Investigations Department during the period 27.07.2001-28.12.2001.
<br><br>
Furthermore, it should be mentioned that, based on the content of the disputed Ordinance of 16.10.2001, the examination of the circumstances was carried out in line with the provisions of art.93 of the Criminal Procedure Code (in the wording of the 1961 Law). According to the information presented by the Secretariat and Audience Department of the General Prosecutor's Office, in 2001 the General Prosecutor's Office's office kept records of the materials examined according to art.93 of the Criminal Procedure Code only as statistical evidence of criminal cases which were initiated by General Prosecutor's Office, and did not keep the Register no. 1 (R-1) according to the instructions regarding the unique record of offences, criminal cases and persons who have committed offences.
<br><br>
<b>Following the analysis of the results of the criminal investigation actions carried out, I come to the conclusion that the criminal proceedings in the present criminal case are to be terminated based on the following reasoning:</b>
<br><br>
The special legal object of the offence provided by art.332 par.(2) letter b) of the Criminal Code is constituted by the social relations regarding the good faith in the public service activity, which is conditioned by the public trust in the authenticity of the official documents.
<br><br>
The material or immaterial object of the mentioned offence is the authentic official document (in the event of entering obviously false data in the official documents or in the event of the forgery of official documents, implying the modification of the content of authentic official documents, but not the introduction in such documents of false findings or mentions) or the raw material used in order to forge the official document (in the event of falsification of official documents assuming their forgery). The product of the offence of forgery in public acts is the false official document.
<br><br>
The objective side of the mentioned offence includes the prejudicial act that is expressed in the action of registration in the official documents of some obviously false data or of forgery of such documents.
<br><br>
In essence, the entry of false data in official documents means the introduction of false findings or indications in authentic official documents. The forgery of official documents means either the forgery of official documents or altering the content of authentic official documents.
<br><br>
Thus, initially, at the start of the criminal investigation, there was a reasonable suspicion that the Ordinance of 16.10.2001 issued by prosecutor V. Casu, which is an official document, was forged.
<br><br>
In the course of the criminal investigation, within which multiple criminal prosecution actions were carried out, it was not possible to identify the original existence of this Ordinance, given the long time since its issuance. Moreover, as mentioned, in 2001 the Chancellery of the General Prosecutor's Office kept the records of the materials examined according to art.93 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (in the wording of the Law of 1961) only as statistical evidence of criminal cases initiated by the prosecutors of the General Prosecutor's Office, while the Register no. 1 (R-1) according to the instructions regarding the unique record of the offences, of the criminal cases and of the persons who committed offences was not kept.
<br><br>
The presence of only one copy of the Ordinance of 16.10.2001, issued by prosecutor V. Casu, was found in the materials accumulated by the Court of Accounts in 2002 on the audit of the activity of the Joint Stock Company “Banca de Economii” during 01.04.1999-31.12.2001 (Decision of the Court of Accounts no. 56 of 26.06.2002, volume 47/7 – year 2002, page 130 - 132), and those materials are already archived at the National Archives Agency.
<br><br>
The circumstances which constitute the subject of the investigation in view of art.93 of the Criminal Procedure Code (in the wording of the 1961 Law) and which are indicated in the disputed Ordinance of 16.10.2001 are subject to verification according to the competence of other institutions.
<br><br>
All the more, V. Casu, under oath and warned of criminal liability for false testimony, attested to the examination of the circumstances according to art.93 of the Criminal Procedure Code (in the wording of the 1961 Law) and the issuance on 16.10.2001, based on the findings, of the Ordinance of refusing to initiate the criminal case.
<br><br>
Witness V. Castravet, under oath and warned of criminal liability for false testimony, also confirmed the examination of the circumstances according to art.93 of the Criminal Procedure Code (in the wording of the 1961 Law) and the issuance of the Ordinance at issue.
<br><br>
<b>Accordingly, based on the findings of the criminal investigation, we can conclude that the Ordinance of 16.10.2001 of refusing to initiate the criminal case existed in fact, and was issued by the Deputy Chief Prosecutor of the Financial-Economic Investigations Department Valentin Casu, a copy of which Ordinance is found in the materials of the Court of Accounts for 2002 on the audit of the activity of the Joint Stock Company “Banca de Economii” S.A. for 01.04.1999-31.12.2001 (Decision of the Court of Accounts no. 56 of 26.06.2002), which attests to the lack of the fact of an offence.</b>
<br><br>
According to the provisions of Article 1 par.(2) and (3) of the Criminal Procedure Code, “The purpose of a criminal proceeding is to protect individuals, society and the state from crime and to protect individuals and society from illegal acts of officials in the course of investigating crimes either alleged or committed so that any person who has committed a crime is punished to the extent of his/her guilt and no innocent person is subject to criminal liability and convicted.”; “In the course of proceedings, criminal investigative bodies and the courts shall act in a manner such that no one is unjustifiably suspected, accused or convicted and no one is arbitrarily or unnecessarily subjected to coercive procedural measures.”
<br><br>
According to the provisions of Article 8 par.(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code, “Conclusions on a person’s guilt in the commission of a crime may not be based on suppositions. By proving guilt, all doubts that cannot be eliminated under this Code shall be interpreted in favour of the suspect/accused/defendant.”, and the provisions of Article 6 par.2 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms of 04.11.1950, “Everyone charged with a criminal offence shall be presumed innocent until proven guilty according to law.”
<br><br>
According to the provisions of Article 27 of the Criminal Procedure Code: “The person carrying out a criminal investigation shall assess evidence according to their own convictions formed after examining all the evidence managed. No evidence shall have a pre-established force of argument.”
<br><br>
According to the provisions of Article 101 of the Criminal Procedure Code, “all evidence shall be assessed from the point of view of its pertinence, conclusiveness, usefulness and validity, and the entire body of evidence shall be assessed from the point of view of its comparability. A representative of the criminal investigative body shall assess the evidence based on his/her personal conviction formed as a result of a comprehensive and objective examination of its totality and in line with the law.”
<br><br>
According to Article 275(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code: “Criminal investigations may not be initiated and if initiated may not be conducted and shall be terminated if there is no criminal event.”
<br><br>
According to the provisions of Article 286 of the Criminal Procedure Code: “The dismissing of a criminal case is ordered by the prosecutor, ex officio or at the suggestion of the criminal investigative body, should there be no accused in the case and should one of the circumstances provided in art.275 para. (1) points 1)–3).”
<div class='cnt'>/f.p.n.203-207, 208-215/</div>
<br>
<div style='border:1px solid #aaa;padding:18px;'>Consequently, the <b>AUTHENTICITY</b> and <b>PROVENANCE</b> of the Ordinance of 16.10.2001, issued by the Deputy Head of the Financial-Economic Investigation Department of the General Prosecutor's Office, Valentin Casu, which ordered “to refuse the initiation of a criminal case in respect of the materials concerning the activity of Banca de Economii S.A. due to lack of constitutive elements of an offence in the deed of a public officer” (presented in copy to the courts by the defence, and which raised doubts both in the court of first instance and in the court of appeal, the latter stating that it “cannot be taken into account and that a decision to terminate the criminal proceedings cannot be based on a photocopy of the Ordinance of 16.10.2001 on the refusal to initiate criminal proceedings, <u>the authenticity and provenance of which arouse suspicion</u>”) <b>were CONFIRMED WITH CERTAINTY AND WITHOUT ANY DOUBT</b> by the circumstances established as a result of the criminal investigation on the criminal case no. 2012928105, as well as by the information submitted by the General Prosecutor's Office no. 24-87/10-379 of 05.03.2013.
</div>
<br>
The circumstances described above CONFIRM that both at the initiation of the prosecution in the criminal case against Viorel Tudor Topa and at his trial in the first instance, appeal and recourse, there was the Ordinance of the General Prosecutor's Office of 16 October 2001 on the refusal to initiate criminal proceedings against V. Topa, and this Ordinance’s authenticity and veracity was verified and confirmed after his conviction, both by the <b>issuing institution − the General Prosecutor's Office</b>, and by the results of the criminal investigation carried out in the criminal case no. 20121228105.
<br><br>
It is obvious that the facts addressed in the aforementioned Ordinance were the subject of a complex investigation conducted by the General Prosecutor's Office of the Republic of Moldova in 2001 with respect to the premature withdrawal by “Sparks Management Corporation” from the bank headed by V. Topa of the deposits that served as pledge for the loans granted to “Air Moldova International” S.A. and other economic customers of “Banca de Economii” S.A.
<br><br>
Consequently, the Financial-Economic Investigations Department of the General Prosecutor's Office established the lack of constituent elements of any offence in the actions of all persons in charge within the Bank, including Viorel Topa, for which reason it was refused to initiate the criminal case by the Ordinance of 16.10.2001
<br><br>
The Ordinance of 16.10.2001 had and continues to have the status of <b>res judicata</b>, and remained final as it was never challenged.
<br><br>
According to Article 22 of the Criminal Procedure Code,<br>
(1)	<b>No one may be prosecuted by criminal investigative bodies, tried or punished by the court several times for the same crime.</b><br>
(2)	A person must be discharged or a criminal investigation must be terminated to prevent pressing repeated charges against the same person for the same act except in cases when new or recently discovered facts come to light or if a fundamental breach of justice in the previous proceeding affected the respective judgment.<br>
(3)	The decision of the criminal investigative body to discharge a person or to terminate criminal investigations, and the final court judgment shall prevent from resuming the criminal investigation pressing more severe charges or setting a more severe punishment for the same person and for the same act except for cases when new or recently discovered facts come to light or a fundamental breach in the previous proceeding affected the judgment issued.
<br><br>
According to <u>Article 275 of the Criminal Procedure Code</u>,<br>
“Criminal investigations may not be initiated and if initiated may not be conducted and shall be terminated if:<br>
1) there is no criminal event;<br>
2) the act is not defined in criminal law as a crime;<br>
3) the act does not contain the elements of a crime except for cases when the crime was committed by a legal entity;<br>
4) the limitation period has expired or amnesty has been granted;<br>
5) the perpetrator has deceased except in cases of rehabilitating a reputation;<br>
6) there is no complaint by a victim in a criminal investigation that starts as per art.276, only based on such a complaint;<br>
7) with regard to a person, there is a final court judgment on the same charge or stating the impossibility of conducting a criminal investigation on the same grounds;<br>
8) <b>with regard to a person there is an outstanding judgment on the non-initiation of a criminal investigation or on the termination of a criminal investigation on the same charge</b>;<br>
9)	there are other circumstances provided by law that call for the elimination or, as the case may be, eliminate a criminal investigation.”
<br><br>
According to Article 285 par.(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code, “A criminal investigation shall terminate in the cases listed in Article 275 p. 4)-9) and if it is established that there is present at least one of the circumstances or one of the cases provided in Articles 35 and 53 of the Criminal Code.”
<br><br>
According to Article 332 of the Criminal Procedure Code, “(1) Should in the course of the case hearing one of the grounds set forth in arts. 275 points 2)–9), 285, par.(1) points 1), 2), 4), 5) be established, and in cases provided in arts. 53–60 of the Criminal Code, <b>the court shall terminate the criminal proceeding on the respective case in a reasoned sentence.</b>”
<br><br>
According to Article 391 par.(1) p.5) of the Criminal Procedure Code, “The sentence of termination of the criminal proceeding shall be issued if <b>there is a decision of a criminal investigative body in regard to the same person for the same act terminating the criminal investigation, discharging the person from the criminal investigation or dismissing the criminal case.</b>”
<br><br>
According to Article 4 par.1 of the Protocol no. 7 to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, “no one shall be liable to be tried or punished again in criminal proceedings under the jurisdiction of the same State for an offence for which he has already been finally acquitted or convicted in accordance with the law and penal procedure of that State.”
<br><br>
The text of this rule, applicable pursuant to Article 4 paragraph (2) of the Constitution of the Republic of Moldova, also applies when a person has been the subject of a criminal investigation that has not led to a conviction, since in criminal matters the principle <b>non bis in idem</b> is applicable regardless of whether or not the pursued person has been convicted, otherwise it would not have been necessary to associate in the text the term “pursued” with the term “convicted”.
<br><br>
According to the Decision Zigarella vs. Italy of 03.10.2002, Recueil IX [6 ECHR], the Court ruled that the Italian courts had initiated a new criminal investigation, ignoring the existence of the first investigation, but that they had terminated the second as soon as they realised the situation thus created. The European Court of Human Rights stated that it was faced with a situation in which the applicant had been prosecuted twice for the same offense, on the basis of the same facts, as it consisted of identical circumstances or events which were essentially the same.
<br><br>
In these circumstances, the prosecutor concludes that the evidence gathered within the review procedure <b>confirms the existence of the procedural act of 16.10.2001</b>.
<br><br>
Considering that sufficient evidence has been gathered in the review procedure which establish the circumstances unknown to the court when issuing the judgment and which, separately or in conjunction with the circumstances previously established, prove that on the same circumstances and actions imputed to the convicted <b>Viorel Topa, prior to his conviction</b>, the prosecutors ordered a solution of refusal in initiating criminal proceedings – a solution which is not annulled through procedures provided by the legal framework; and that the criminal investigation in the review procedure is complete and there is the necessary and legally administered evidence, based on Articles 461 and 391 paragraph (1) point 5) of the Criminal Procedure Code,
<br><br>
<div class='cnt'>I HEREBY ORDER:</div>
