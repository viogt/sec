He reportedly quizzed random passers-by about his merits.
Keep track of bloodline.
Guilty of actions surrounding the events of that time.
Let him stew for a while.
Bloated with self-importance.
I'm stuffed.
People runs riot, behave in uncontrolled way, imagination is running riot.


Assemble from available parts, cobble.
About what it did once it got there.
Interpreted to mean just about anything if you squint at them hard enough, narrow eyes to see better.
Idea often hyped in popular publications.
Have the gall to do something, be bold and brazen enough to do something.
Hoard, accumulate money or valued objects and hide or store away, be a hoarder.
Not going to get away with it.
By all accounts, he can outsmart anybody.


Resort to desperate measures.
Sign it over to him.
You missed orientation.
Know the drill, what needs to be done.
What's the catch, when is presented on its best face and that problems or drawbacks are hidden.
Honour is a commodity.


First, get hold of the entire concept.
I'm just relaying information.
It didn't work out that way.
.Asking what went wrong suggests that it wasn’t misguided from the beginning.
In the language that is nodding to their sentiments.
Those that aid and abet them, instigate and assist to commit a crime.
He doesn't pity them, take pity on them.
It is far more likely to mislead than help.
Be away of the touch of civilisation.
The list of questions goes on.
Overcoming boredom.


De-escalation, travesty of justice, the resolve hardened.
With the wisdom of hindsight, I should have done it – understand only after the event is consumed, with the benefit of hindsight.
And see where it lands you.
Misplaced truth, ill-chosen, ill-timed.
Jog your memory, cause to remember.
I was long-winded, repetitive and rambling.
Just a quibble: one doesn’t usually talk about objects that have no mass.
Quackery, charlatanry, fraud, swindle.


To cheer ourselves up, we are cheerful people.
The solution dawned on us, it began to be realised for the first time.
Determined to root it out, find and remove, steely determination.
How are you getting on, fare, cope, manage.
We'll set to work on this tomorrow.
His statements are controversial, but in all fairness to him, they are also grounded. In fairness.
Fix the problem by staring at it, come up with a solution once we come across the problem.
Implementation at its finest.
You can't contain yourselves, and must rid yourselves of it.


We'll look into it.
A con man, cunning person, a person who uses tricks to cheat people, esp. to get their money or possessions.
Provide ready access, free access.
A viper in bosom, he is rearing a viper for the people.
Be exempt from taxes or duty.
It's just plain wrong, ugly, rude.
Does it get affected by it?
We've rounded up some info for you.
Accept it on trust.


For the avoidance of any doubt.
Thing is, though.
A gesture of goodwill.
Rogue employee, stoke fear.
Learn boundaries, know no boundaries.
Started to trickle into the area, percolate.
Holiday attire, clothes, especially fine or formal ones.
A tendency to stutter while speaking – stammer, talk with continued involuntary repetition of sounds, especially initial consonants.


Pull yourself together, get control of your emotions and actions.
It has no say over this topic.
Everything will become clear in the fullness of time, if you wait long enough.
We need to get the message across that too much sun is dangerous, make them understand the meaning of what we're saying.
With hindsight, I should never have gone, retrospectively.
Then he quipped.
Am I befuddled, invited into error.
You rang, you called me, as common folk.
The answer resides in the following.
Divided with a rather wobbly line.


The only evidence against it is and has always been a rigidly literal interpretation of a single poem which was composed in the Bronze Age and passed along by word of mouth for centuries before it was written down, and which was probably always intended as a metaphor.
More importantly, though, he dismisses any potential role for human choice.
Tilted inwards, double-deck train.


Almost beyond comprehension.
Forgo a long introduction.
Slim chances.
But let's assume for a while that the map is truly reflective of the realities of that remote past.
Unless you have a better idea.
It calls for a closer scrutiny.
Leave us leeway, room to maneuver.
What went through your mind.
Find the circumstances present.
Have it brought or lost.
This means that people fall back on metaphors, analogies or hand-wavy over-simplifications which – unsurprisingly – can confuse more than illuminate.
The decision rests with you.
Be on the fritz, malfunction.


Leader of the pack.
It's something of a cliché.
Despite lingering anger and resentment.
He made it to the top.
He lavishes us with special perks and attention.
No idea what they are getting into.


He doesn’t speak English, much less French.
Or at best it should be thought of as an artistic movement.
I’m easygoing, relaxed and not easily upset or worried.
A quick primer, introductory readings.
Give me a ballpark figure, an estimate, approximate figure.
Pairing wine with food.
Calibrate the bullshit detector.
In the deepest reaches of space.
Appears in all the known forms, and as such is considered.
Don't let be taken in by his words, be fooled, cheated, swindled.


I’m suspicious, but for good reason.
Frivolously, inappropriately silly.
I feel awkward, abashed, but it'll do.
Booze it up, have a booze, a drink.
Shrewdness, acumen, perspicacity.
I get that. He did it on a whim.
For a trifling million or so.
Trifle money away for silly purchases.
Get a much deserved beer.
Railroad him into signing, force in great haste.
Improve on that, get better results than before.
Their money worked miracles.
This idea travelled eastward.


Is subject to condition precedent, before a specific contract is considered in effect or any obligations are expected of either party.
The questions I want answering.
A more appealing option.
Dwindling community, shrinking, gradually diminishing in size, amount, or strength.
Foundation on which it rests.
Wretched, in a very unhappy or unfortunate state.
Enjoy. He takes great pleasure in annoying me.
It doesn't get sorted.
A funny-looking passerby.


Both sides were drawn, willy-nilly, into the conflict, whether you like it or not.
You're ganging up against me.
If you don't fit a specific mold.
Inches away from the tragedy.
Pain inflicted on the victims.
I don't know any of that.
For once in my life.
They are integral to the system.
I bet it is. I bet you are.
Whatever the future holds.
Strange as it might sound, strangely enough.
Here lies the problem.
