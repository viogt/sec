We're being judged by a new yard-stick: not just by how smart we are, or by our training and expertise, but also by how well we handle ourselves and each other. This yard-stick is increasingly applied in choosing who will be hired and who will not, who will be let go and who retained, who passed over and who promoted.<br><br>
These rules have little to do with what we were told was important in school; <i>academic abilities are largely irrelevant to</i> this standard. The new measure takes for granted having enough intellectual ability and technical know-how to do our jobs; it focuses instead on personal qualities, such as initiative and empathy, adaptability and persuasiveness.<br><br>
This is no <i>passing fad</i> (<i>whim</i>, <i>quirk</i>) nor just the management nostrum of the moment. The data that argue for taking it seriously are based on studies of tens of thousands of working people, in callings of every kind. And it demonstrates which human abilities make up the greater part of the ingredients for excellence at work -- most especially for leadership.<br><br>
If you are part of a management team, you need to consider whether your organisation <i>fosters</i> these competencies or discourages them.<br>An emotional competence is a learned capability based on emotional intelligence that results in <i>outstanding</i> performance at work (extraordinary, <i>nontrivial</i>).<br>Competencies come in clusters. For top performance a person must master a mix of competencies, not just one or two.<br>Only when they reach a critical mass from the full spectrum do they emerge as outstanding-something akin to a chemical reaction achieved the moment of catalysis.<br><br>
The conclusions of a <i>landmark study</i> of top executives who <i>derailed</i>, the two most <i>common traits</i> of those who failed.<br>The single most frequently mentioned factor: being too <i>harshly</i> critical, insensitive or <i>demanding</i>, so that they alienated those they worked with.<br>Trustworthiness: The failures typically were overly ambitious, too ready to get ahead at the expense of other people.<br><br>Obvious: It isn't that they can't see the solution - they can't see the problem.<br><br>Contemplation: People at this stage see that they need to improve and have begun to think about how to do so. Ambivalence is <i>rampant</i>: some wait for a "magic moment" of readiness. People at this stage are as likely to say they intend to take some action "next month" as they are to say they'll do it "in the next six months". It's not unusual for people "to spend" years telling them that someday they are going to change". They substitute thinking for acting.<br><br>Preparation: Here people have begun to focus on the solution - on how to improve. They are aware of the problem, see that there are ways to solve it, and <i>palpably</i> anticipate doing so. This is the time for formulating a specific, detailed plan of action.<br>Action: Visible change begins. People <i>embrace</i> the plan, start practising its steps, and actually change how they act - their emotional patterns, the way they think about themselves, and all the other facets of transforming a <i>long-standing habit</i>.<br><br>
<i>Feedback lies at the heart</i> of change. Knowing how we are doing <i>keeps us on track</i>. In its most basic form, feedback means that someone notices whether -- or how well -- the new competence is being used and lets us know.<br>Emotional competence cannot be improved overnight, because the motional brain changes its habits over weeks and months, not hours and days.<br><br>The children love <i>roaming about</i> in the fields and woods.<br>Somebody remains <i>committed to</i> the principles of...<br><br>

...from raindrops in the sky to the planets in the solar system.<br>The attempts to develop a unified field theory are <i>grounded in the belief that</i> all physical phenomena should ultimately be explainable by some <i>underlying unity</i>.<br><br>
<i>At first glance</i>, the sudden jump from 8000 BC to 10,000 years ago <i>looks peculiar</i>.<br><br>
In the typical business cycle expansion, business firms will <i>exhibit optimism about</i> the economic outlook.<br><br>
<i>In this fashion</i>...
The fundamental requirement is stable expansion of money and credit commensurate with real growth and financial market needs.<br><br>

Whether the measurements are <i>clustered tightly around</i> the mean or spread over the range.<br>The statistician is often <i>called upon to decide whether</i> an assumed hypothesis for some phenomenon is valid or not.<br><br>
They prefer to <i>bargain with</i> individual clients.<br><br>
The origin of the genus Homo (as our <i>remote ancestors, precursor, predecessor, forerunner</i>) has long <i>intrigued</i> scientists and <i>prompted much debate</i>.<br><br>
<i>In either case</i>, more scientific documentation is necessary to <i>strongly support</i> or <i>refute</i> the idea that early Homo arose as part of a larger trend of rapid species extinction and the evolution of many new species during a period of environmental change.<br><br>
Humans <i>evolved in Africa</i> and lived only there for as long as 4 million years or more, so scientists wonder what finally triggered the first human migration out of Africa (a movement that coincided with the spread of early human populations throughout the African continent).<br><br>
Along with many physical similarities, Neanderthals <i>differed from</i> modern humans in several ways.<br><br>

The event occurred <i>for two weeks now</i>. <i>Grip of power</i>.<br><i>Bound to the same source</i>.<br><i>Swallow a bitter pill</i>.<br>Only a <i>fraction of</i> the whole.<br><br>

To <i>waive privilege</i>.<br><i>Aiming at</i> signing a waiver of their rights.<br>A <i>ruthless manipulator</i>, showing no compassion or mercy.<br><br>
<i>Unrestrained</i>, unconstrained, wanton disregard, <i>outrageous breach of</i> all limits, of any restraint, outrage - <i>extreme illegality</i>.<br>He spins/forwards his version/interpretation.<br><br>
He <i>severely trespasses upon</i> the tolerance.<br>To <i>trespass against the law and common sense</i>.<br>To trespass upon others' rights.<br><br>
<i>Spooky actions</i>, coincidence (ghost), his stupid <i>blunder</i> (mistake, <i>slip</i>, gaffe), without glasses he blundered into a wrong room.<br>A slip of the tongue - a mistake.<br><br>Tremendous talent.<br><br>

*Ovid/Metamorphoses: Chance is always powerful. Let your <i>hook be always cast</i>; in the pool where you least expect it, there will be a fish. Anything <i>cracked</i> will <i>shatter</i> at a touch. Dignity and love do not blend well, nor do they continue long together. Nothing is stronger than habit. I am dragged along by a strange new force. Desire and reason are <i>pulling</i> in different directions. I see the right way and approve it, but follow the wrong. It is convenient that there be gods, and, as it is convenient, let us believe there are. By yielding you may obtain victory. The cause is hidden. The effect is visible to all.

Better safe than sorry.<br>
East or West, home is best.<br>
Many a true word is spoken in jest.<br>
Every why has a wherefore.<br>
Every cook praises his own broth.<br>
Still waters run deep.<br>
The chain is no stronger than its weakest link.<br>
A friend in need is a friend indeed.<br>
He that once deceives is ever suspected.<br>
Two wrongs do not make a right.<br>
The game is not worth the candle.<br>
It is never too late to mend (repair).<br>
Truth lies at the bottom of a well.<br>
Don't change horses in midstream. Don't swap horses when crossing a stream.<br>
When the cat is away, the mice will play.<br>
Too far East is West. Opposites attract.<br>
Brevity is the soul of wit.<br>
Rats desert a sinking ship. Rats leave a sinking ship.<br>
Great talkers are little doers.<br>
Best defence is offence.<br>
Silence gives consent. Silence means consent.<br>
God helps those who help themselves.<br>
Don't trouble trouble until trouble troubles you.<br>

</td><td valign="top">

Don't make a mountain out of a molehill.<br>
Catch the bear before you sell his skin.<br>
No safe wading in an unknown water.<br>
He who makes no mistakes makes nothing.<br>
There is but one step from the sublime to the ridiculous.<br>
A fault confessed is half redressed.<br>
Like cures like.<br>
After us the deluge.<br>
Prevention is better than cure. A stitch in time saves nine.<br>
Forewarned is forearmed.<br>
Habit is a second nature. Custom is a second nature.<br>
One must drink as one brews.<br>
Who keeps company with the wolf will learn to howl.<br>
A man is known by the company he keeps.<br>
Death pays all debts. Death squares all accounts. Death quits all scores.<br>
Great barkers are no biters.<br>
The proof of the pudding is in the eating.<br>
More haste, less speed.<br>
Too many cooks spoil the broth. Everybody's business is nobody's business.<br>
A drowning man will catch at a straw.<br>
A bad compromise is better than a good lawsuit.<br>
The end justifies the means.<br>
To err is human.<br>
You never know what you have till it's gone.<br>
The pen is mightier than the sword.<br>
Drunkenness reveals what soberness conceals.
